# Testing GOV.UK Pay

When your GOV.UK Pay account is [switched to
live](/switching_to_live/#switching-to-live), you will still have a ‘test’
account for general testing and experimenting with different settings and
features.

When you test, you should make sure that you’ve tested with [mock card
numbers](/#mock-card-numbers-for-testing-purposes) to simulate both successful
and unsuccessful transactions. You must use test cards with your test account.
Real card numbers will not work.

You should also:

 - only use your test account, not your live account
 - make sure that test calls to the GOV.UK Pay API succeed with [200 codes](/api_reference/#http-status-codes)
 - [test the whole user journey](/#test-your-service-with-your-users) from your service to the payment service provider

#### HTTP with test accounts

Services using test accounts can optionally use HTTP (rather than HTTPS)
for return URLs. You can read more about this in [the __Security__
section](/security/#https).

### Make a demo payment

You can [try the payment experience as a
user](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/make-a-demo-payment), and
then view the completed payment as a GOV.UK Pay administrator.

### Test your service with your users

You can [create a reusable
link](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/test-with-your-users) to
integrate your service prototype with GOV.UK Pay, and test with your users.

## Integration testing

To check your integration with GOV.UK Pay is working as expected, you should
run a series of tests. You can read more about [software
testing](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology#testing-your-service)
and [smoke
testing](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/deployment.html) in
the GOV.UK Service Manual.

Ideally you should build tests to include both the GOV.UK Pay API and its
frontend user journey. The GOV.UK Pay interface is continuously iterated, so
you should not rely on any specific page layout. You can still build tests
that address form elements such as buttons, using their IDs. Alternatively,
you can build stubs that will emulate GOV.UK Pay functionality.

You can read [the __Versioning__ section](/versioning/#versioning) to find out
about the evolution of the GOV.UK Pay API.

If you experience any problems when testing, please email us at
[govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

## Performance testing

If you’d like to carry out any kind of performance testing, including in a
rate-limiting environment, please contact us at
[govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

## Mock card numbers for testing

When you’re testing your integration, you must not use real card numbers. Use
the below test numbers.

When you’re using these card numbers, you can enter any valid value for the
other details (name, expiry date, card security code etc). For example, it
expiry dates must be in the future.
