# Test your integration

<%= warning_text('In September 2024, we limited each GOV.UK Pay service to one live account and one test account.<br><br>This change did not affect most GOV.UK Pay services.') %>

## How test accounts work in GOV.UK Pay

Each GOV.UK Pay service has:

* one test account to test how GOV.UK Pay works
* one live account to take real payments from users

Your test account type depends on your chosen payment service provider (PSP). 

| Payment service provider       | Test account type    |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------  |
| Stripe                         | Stripe test account  |
| Worldpay                       | Sandbox test account |

You're limited to one test account per GOV.UK Pay service. For example, if you have a sandbox test account, you cannot request a Stripe test account on the same GOV.UK Pay service.

### Get a Stripe test account

You can use a Stripe test account to see how the following work:

* [transaction fees](/reporting/#psp-fees)
* payments to your bank account

You already have a Stripe test account if you created your GOV.UK Pay service after September 2024 and chose Stripe as your PSP.

You may have a sandbox test account if you created your GOV.UK Pay service before September 2024 and chose Stripe as your PSP.

It is not possible to swap a sandbox test account for a Stripe test account within the same GOV.UK Pay service. To get a Stripe test account, you need to create a new GOV.UK Pay service.

1. [Sign in to the GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services).
1. Select **Add a new service**. 
1. When asked which type of organisation you work for, select **Local authority, armed forces or police**.
1. Select **Create service**.

Your new service will have a Stripe test account.

Test data and API keys in your sandbox test account will not be available in your Stripe test account.

Stripe test accounts have [a different set of mock card numbers](#if-you-39-re-using-a-test-stripe-account).

### Get a Worldpay test account

It’s possible to link a Worldpay test account to GOV.UK Pay. Some services might find a Worldpay test account useful to connect GOV.UK Pay to Worldpay’s reporting products.

For most organisations, a Worldpay test account is not necessary and we do not recommend using it. GOV.UK Pay cannot support you if you encounter problems.

You can test the entire payment journey with a standard GOV.UK Pay test account, as well as:

* reporting on payments
* smoke testing
* viewing and refunding transactions

If you get a Worldpay test account, you should not use it for long term, automated testing.

Email GOV.UK Pay support (govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) to request a Worldpay test account. If GOV.UK Pay support approves your request, we will add your Worldpay test account as a separate GOV.UK Pay service.

## Testing your service

You can use your test account to:

- explore how the GOV.UK Pay API works
- run automated [smoke tests](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/deploying-software-regularly#using-smoke-tests-after-you-deploy)

Do not use your test account for automated integration tests that run every time you change your code. Build a ‘stub’ to simulate the GOV.UK Pay API instead, using a tool like [WireMock](https://wiremock.org/).

## Testing the whole user journey

You should test the whole user journey.

If you're using the API integration, you can create a link to GOV.UK Pay payment pages and add it to your service's test page.

1. [Select the account you want to test in the GOV.UK admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services).
2. Select **Test with your users** to create the link.

You can also:

- use [mock card numbers](#mock-card-numbers) to test both successful and unsuccessful payments
- use HTTP instead of HTTPs for the `return_url` with your test account, so you do not need to set up a secure url for testing
- test any [payment links](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/) you have set up

You cannot use 3D Secure (3DS) with test accounts.

## Performance testing

You must [contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information) to get written approval before you do any performance testing.

## Mock card numbers and email addresses

Use mock card numbers and email addresses with your test account when you try payments as a user.

Do not use real card numbers or fake email addresses with your test account.

You must use mock email addresses when doing automated testing. If you are testing manually, you can use real email addresses.

You can enter any valid value for other payment fields. For example, the card expiry date can be any date in the future.

### Mock card numbers

Mock card numbers do not work with your live account.

There are separate sets of mock card numbers for:

* [GOV.UK Pay test accounts](#if-you-39-re-using-a-test-39-sandbox-39-account) 
* [Stripe test accounts](#if-you-39-re-using-a-test-stripe-account)

##### Testing recurring payments on a test account

Recurring payments are made up of two stages:

1. An initial payment to set up the agreement for recurring payments.
2. Further recurring payments that are taken automatically without a user's input.

To test both stages, we offer mock cards that have two testing actions - one for the initial payment and one for the further recurring payments.

|Testing actions |Card number | Card brand | Card type |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
|1. Successul set up payment<br><br>2. Successful recurring payment | 4000056655665556 | Visa | Debit |
|1. Successful set up payment<br><br>2. Unsuccessful recurring payment | 5105105105105100 | Mastercard | Debit |

#### If you're using a test Stripe account

The [PSP transaction fee](/reporting/#psp-fees) depends on which country the test card is from.

|Testing action |Card number |Card brand |Card type | Country |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|

##### Testing recurring payments on a test Stripe account

There are additional mock card numbers to test recurring payments with Stripe. 

Use these cards to test the two main steps of [the recurring payment flow](/recurring_payments/#how-recurring-payments-work):

* taking a payment to set up an agreement for recurring payments
* taking further recurring payments without user input

Each card has a different result for these two steps.

| Testing actions                                                            | Card number      | Card brand | Card type | Country |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------- |
| Successful set up payment without 3DS<br><br>Successful recurring payments | 4242424242424242 | Visa       | Credit    | US      |
| Successful set up payment with 3DS<br><br>Successful recurring payments    | 4000002500003155 | Visa       | Credit    | France  |
| Successful set up payment with 3DS<br><br>Unsuccessful recurring payments  | 4000002760003184 | Visa       | Credit    | Germany |
| Unsuccessful set up payment                                                | 4000000000009995 | Visa       | Credit    | US      |

### Mock email addresses

Use one of the following mock email addresses when doing automated testing:

- simulate-delivered@notifications.service.gov.uk
- simulate-delivered-2@notifications.service.gov.uk
- simulate-delivered-3@notifications.service.gov.uk
