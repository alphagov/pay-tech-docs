# Scheduled GOV.UK Pay maintenance

GOV.UK Pay will be unavailable for three 4-hour windows during November 2023. 

We’ve also scheduled two backup windows that we’ll only use if we cannot complete the maintenance work in time.

## Full GOV.UK Pay outages

GOV.UK Pay will be completely unavailable on the following dates:

* Tuesday 14 November, 4am to 8am
* Tuesday 21 November, 4am to 8am

During these times, you cannot:

* create or take any payments
* use the GOV.UK Pay API
* sign in to the GOV.UK Pay admin tool
* query, report on or refund any payments

If there are any issues with the maintenance during either of these windows, we have scheduled a backup date:

* Tuesday 28 November, 4am to 8am

## Partial GOV.UK Pay outage

Parts of GOV.UK Pay will be unavailable on the following date:

* Wednesday 15 November, 10am to 2pm

During this time, you cannot:

* sign in to the GOV.UK Pay admin tool
* use the API to search for transactions
* take recurring payments

You'll still be able to:

* create and take one-off payments through the API
* check an individual payment's status through the API
* take payments using existing payment links
* refund payments through the API

If there are any issues with the maintenance during this window, we have scheduled a backup date:

* Thursday 16 November, 10am to 2pm

## Communicate the maintenance with stakeholders

You should communicate this scheduled downtime to relevant stakeholders. This could include call centre staff, case workers, and technical teams.

If your service has a technical team, you should:

* check if there are any automated jobs scheduled to run during the maintenance windows and check they can handle errors appropriately

* check if you can show your users a maintenance page earlier in their online journey to prevent them from reaching the payment stage of your service

* make them aware that we will still deliver webhooks messages but they may be delayed by the maintenance

## Check the GOV.UK Pay status page

We’ll keep the [GOV.UK Pay status page](https://payments.statuspage.io/) updated as we complete the scheduled maintenance.
