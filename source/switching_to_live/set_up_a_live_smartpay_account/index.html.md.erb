# Connect your live account to SmartPay

This is part of [going live](/switching_to_live/#go-live).

To connect your live account to SmartPay, you must:

- have already connected at least one live GOV.UK account to SmartPay before 1 August 2020
- be an admin on your GOV.UK Pay account

If you do not meet these requirements, you must connect your live GOV.UK Pay account to either [GOV.UK's contracted payment service provider (PSP)](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_stripe_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-stripe) or [Government Banking's contracted PSP](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-worldpay).

## Configure your user profile on SmartPay

Sign in to your [SmartPay account](https://ca-live.barclaycardSmartPay.com/ca/ca/login.shtml). Select your organisation name at the top of the page, then the correct merchant account.

### Set up an ‘API user’

You must set up a username and password that SmartPay will use to connect to the GOV.UK Pay API.

1. Select __Settings__ then __Users__.

2. Select __Add new user__.

3. Select __Web Service__ as the user type.

4. Complete both the __Password__ fields.

    You should follow the guidance about [choosing and storing passwords](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/top-tips-for-staying-secure-online/password-managers) from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).

You'll need to copy the username and password into your GOV.UK Pay account later.

Contact SmartPay if any of these roles are not in the list.

Select __Accounts__. Enable your merchant account, then select __Save__.

### Edit allowed user IP range

Set the __IP address__ to `0.0.0.1`.

Leave the other options as their defaults.

You'll need to copy this username and password into your GOV.UK Pay account later.
