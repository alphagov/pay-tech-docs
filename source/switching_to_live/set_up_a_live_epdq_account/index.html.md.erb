# Connect your live account to ePDQ

This is part of [going live](/switching_to_live/#go-live).

To connect your live account to ePDQ, you must:

- have already connected at least one live GOV.UK account to ePDQ before 1 August 2020
- be an admin on both your GOV.UK Pay and ePDQ accounts

If you do not meet these requirements, you must connect your live GOV.UK Pay account to either [GOV.UK's contracted payment service provider (PSP)](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_stripe_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-stripe) or [Government Banking's contracted PSP](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-worldpay).

## Add payment methods to your account

If you only want to accept Visa and Mastercard, you do not need to follow these steps, because ePDQ will have already added them by default.

1. Sign in to your [ePDQ account](https://payments.epdq.co.uk/Ncol/Prod/BackOffice/login/index).
