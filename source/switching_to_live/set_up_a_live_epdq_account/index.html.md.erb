# Connect your live account to ePDQ

This is part of [going live](/switching_to_live/#go-live).

To connect your live account to ePDQ, you must:

- have already connected at least one live GOV.UK account to ePDQ before 1 August 2020
- be an admin on both your GOV.UK Pay and ePDQ accounts

If you do not meet these requirements, you must connect your live GOV.UK Pay account to either [GOV.UK's contracted payment service provider (PSP)](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_stripe_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-stripe) or [Government Banking's contracted PSP](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-worldpay).

## Add payment methods to your account

If you only want to accept Visa and Mastercard, you do not need to follow these steps, because ePDQ will have already added them by default.

1. Sign in to your [ePDQ account](https://payments.epdq.co.uk/Ncol/Prod/BackOffice/login/index).

2. Select the __Configuration__ tab, then __Payment methods__.

3. Select __Choose new payment methods__.

4. Select __Add__ next to the card types you want to accept.

5. Complete the fields on the __Contract data__ tab, then select __Submit__.
