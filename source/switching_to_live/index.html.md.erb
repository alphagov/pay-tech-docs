# Go live

Follow these steps to start taking real payments from users.

## Before you start

You must:

- have successfully finished [testing your integration using your test account](/testing_govuk_pay/#test-your-integration)
- read about [Payment Service Provider (PSP) fees](/reporting/#psp-fees)
- have a secure domain for your service, because you must use HTTPS for the `return_url` when you [create a payment](/making_payments/#creating-a-payment) in a live service
- sign up for updates on the [GOV.UK Pay status page](https://payments.statuspage.io), so you get a notification when there's an incident
- know how to [contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) to report an incident

Compared to your test account, your live account may have a:

- slower response time, because GOV.UK Pay must wait for responses from your payment service provider (PSP)
- lower transaction limit - check with your PSP

[Contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) if you need help going live.

## 1. Request a live GOV.UK Pay account

You'll need to tell us:

- your organisation's name and address
- if you’ll be using GOV.UK Pay’s PSP Stripe, or another PSP

Select your test account from the [__My services__](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services) page in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool, then select __Request a live account__.

We'll respond within one working day, and we can usually activate your live account on the same day.

Your live account will appear on the [__My services__ page](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services) in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool, labelled __Live card account__.

You can still use your test account.

## 2. Connect your live account to your PSP

Once you have a GOV.UK Pay live account, you can connect that account to your PSP.

### Connect your live account to GOV.UK Pay's or Government Banking's PSP

You can use either of the following PSPs with GOV.UK Pay:

- GOV.UK Pay's contracted PSP, which is currently [Stripe](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_stripe_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-stripe)
- if you are a central government or health sector organisation, Government Banking's contracted PSP, which is currently [Worldpay](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-worldpay)

If either GOV.UK Pay's or Government Banking's contracted PSP changes, we will work with you to move you on to the new PSP.

### Connect your live account to other PSPs

From 1 August 2020, you cannot use GOV.UK Pay with PSPs that are not GOV.UK's contracted PSP or Government Banking's contracted PSP.

If you already had a live GOV.UK Pay account using any of the following PSPs before 1 August 2020, you can continue to use that PSP with your live account until 31 July 2021:

- [Worldpay](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-worldpay)
- [ePDQ](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_epdq_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-epdq)
- [SmartPay](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_smartpay_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-smartpay)

## 3. Set up 3D Secure

You should [set up 3D Secure payment authentication](/set_up_3dsecure/).

## 4. Choose which card types to accept

Choose which card types to accept by signing into the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/payment-types).

If you use Worldpay, SmartPay or ePDQ, you must also make sure the same card types are selected in your PSP account.

You can also [block prepaid cards](/block_prepaid_cards/#block-prepaid-cards).

### Accept American Express if you use Worldpay

If you use Worldpay and you want to accept American Express cards, you must contact either:

- [Government Banking](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/government-banking-service-gbs) - if your Worldpay contract is through Government Banking
- your Worldpay account manager

You must send your American Express merchant ID to Government Banking or Worldpay if you’re a non-Crown merchant.

## 5. Check your settings match your test account

You need to make the following changes to your live account if you made them to your test account:

- add a custom paragraph to payment confirmation emails
- switch off sending payment confirmation emails
- switch off collecting your users' billing addresses
- switch on sending refund confirmation emails
- add payment links

## 6. Check your live account works

1. Select your live account from the [__My services__ page](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services) in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool.

2. Select __Settings__, then __API keys__.

3. Generate a new live API key.

4. Use the new live API key to test making a real payment on your live account, using the [GOV.UK Pay API](/making_payments/#take-a-payment) or a [payment link](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/).

    You must use a real payment card. Use a small amount, because GOV.UK Pay will take the payment from the card you use.

5. After you've confirmed the payment, check you received a [confirmation email](/payment_flow/#confirmation-email).

6. Check the payment appears in [your transactions](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/transactions) in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool.

7. Select the payment and check you can refund it - it may take up to 20 minutes for the __Refund payment__ button to appear.

If your payment or refund fails, check:

- [your PSP settings](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/your-psp) are correct
- you [connected your live account to your PSP](#2-connect-your-live-account-to-your-psp) correctly
- your ['risk management' settings](/security/#preventing-fraudulent-payments) if your PSP is Worldpay
