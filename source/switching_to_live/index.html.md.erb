# Switching to live

Please read this information carefully.

Follow these steps to switch your account from ‘test’ to ‘live’. You should
only do this when you’ve finished [testing with your test
account](/testing_govuk_pay/#testing-gov-uk-pay), and you’re confident that
[you can make payments successfully](/making_payments/#making-payments).

This guidance is for services that have integrated
with the GOV.UK Pay API or which use the [payment
link](/payment_links/#payment-links) functionality.

Please read the guidance on what to do [before you switch to live](/switching_to_live/before_you_switch_to_live/#before-you-switch-to-live) first.

You can then read about switching to live for: 

* [ePDQ](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_epdq_account) accounts
* [Smartpay](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_smartpay_account) accounts
* [Worldpay](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account) accounts 

## The differences between test and live accounts 

The key differences are:

- return URLs for live services using GOV.UK Pay must use HTTPS, but you [can use HTTP for return URLs with test accounts](https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/security/#https)
- 3D Secure is not part of the payment journey on test accounts
- response times of test accounts do not match live accounts, because live accounts are subject to response times of payment service providers
- the payment links feature is only available for live accounts
