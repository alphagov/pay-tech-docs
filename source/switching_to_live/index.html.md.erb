# Go live

Follow these steps to start taking real payments from users.

## Before you start

You must:

- have successfully finished [testing your integration using your test account](/testing_govuk_pay/#test-your-integration)
- read about [Payment Service Provider (PSP) fees](/reporting/#psp-fees) (Stripe only)
- have a secure domain for your service, because you must use HTTPS for the `return_url` when you [create a payment](/making_payments/#creating-a-payment) in a live service (does not apply if you use [payment links](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/))
- sign up for updates on the [GOV.UK Pay status page](https://payments.statuspage.io), so you get a notification when there's an incident
- know how to [contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/) to report an incident or if you need help going live

Compared to your test account, your live account may have a:

- slower response time, because GOV.UK Pay must wait for responses from your payment service provider (PSP)
- lower transaction limit - check with your PSP

## 1. Request a live GOV.UK Pay account

You'll need to:

- provide your organisation's name and address
- tell us if you’ll be using GOV.UK Pay’s PSP Stripe, or another PSP
- read and accept our legal terms

Select your test ('sandbox') account or your test Stripe account in the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services), then select __Request a live account__.

We'll respond within one working day, and we can usually activate your live account on the same day.

Your live account will appear on the __My services__ page in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool, labelled __Live account__.

You can still use your test account.

## 2. Connect your live account to your PSP

Once you have a GOV.UK Pay live account, you can connect that account to your payment service provider (PSP).

You can connect your live account to:

- [Stripe](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_stripe_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-stripe), GOV.UK Pay's current PSP
- [Worldpay](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-worldpay) using a contract through Government Banking or your own Worldpay contract

You cannot use your own Worldpay contract after 31 July 2021. You must either switch to GOV.UK Pay’s PSP or a contract through Government Banking. [Contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/) as soon as possible if you need to switch.

Until 31 July 2021, we also support connecting your live account to [ePDQ](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_epdq_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-epdq). You can only connect new live accounts to ePDQ if you connected another live account to ePDQ before 1 August 2020

If either GOV.UK Pay's or Government Banking's PSP changes, we'll work with you to move you to the new PSP.

## 3. Set up Strong Customer Authentication

You must [set up Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)](/set_up_3dsecure/#set-up-strong-customer-authentication-3ds1-and-3ds2) by:

- 31 December 2020 if you take payments from the European Economic Area (EEA), defined as the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein
- 14 September 2021 if you only take payments from within the UK

To implement SCA, you must set up 3D Secure 2 (3DS2) or 3D Secure 1 (3DS1) payment authentication.

How you set up 3DS2 or 3DS1 payment authentication depends on which Payment Service Provider (PSP) you’re using.

## 4. Choose which card types to accept

Choose which card types to accept by [selecting the account in the GOV.UK admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services) and selecting **Settings**.

If you use Worldpay or ePDQ, you must also make sure the same card types are selected in your PSP account.

You can also [block prepaid cards](/block_prepaid_cards/#block-prepaid-cards).

### Accept American Express if you use Worldpay

If you use Worldpay and you want to accept American Express cards, you must contact either:

- [Government Banking](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/government-banking-service-gbs) - if your Worldpay contract is through Government Banking
- your Worldpay account manager

You must send your American Express merchant ID to Government Banking or Worldpay if you’re a non-Crown merchant.

## 5. Check your settings match your test account

You need to make the following changes to your live account if you made them to your test account:

- add a custom paragraph to payment confirmation emails
- switch off sending payment confirmation emails
- switch off collecting your users' billing addresses
- switch on sending refund confirmation emails
- add payment links

## 6. Check your live account works

To check your live account works, you must make a real payment and then check if that payment was successful.

You make a real payment using either:

- the GOV.UK Pay API if you have [integrated with the API](/integrate_with_govuk_pay/#integrate-with-the-gov-uk-pay-api)
- a payment link if you are [using payment links](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/)

### Make a payment using the GOV.UK Pay API

1. Select your live account from the [__My services__ page](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services) in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool.

1. Select __Settings__, then __API keys__.

1. Generate a new live API key.

1. [Make a real payment](/making_payments/#take-a-payment) using the new live API key.

    You must use a real payment card. Use a small amount, because GOV.UK Pay will take the payment from the card you use.

    If you want to see the payment in your bank account, make sure the payment amount is [above the minimum payout](/integrate_with_govuk_pay/#receiving-payments).

### Make a payment using a payment link

1. Select your live account from the [__My services__ page](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services) in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool.

1. Create a payment link on your live account.

1. Make a real payment using the live payment link.

    You must use a real payment card. Use a small amount, because GOV.UK Pay will take the payment from the card you use.

    If you want to see the payment in your bank account, make sure the payment amount is [above the minimum payout](/integrate_with_govuk_pay/#receiving-payments).

### Check that the payment was successful

1. After you've confirmed the payment, check you received a [confirmation email](/payment_flow/#confirmation-email).

1. Check the payment appears in [your live transactions](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/all-service-transactions/live) in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool.

1. Select the payment and check you can refund it. It may take up to 20 minutes for the __Refund payment__ button to appear.

If your payment or refund fails, check:

- you [connected your live account to your PSP](#2-connect-your-live-account-to-your-psp) correctly
- your ['risk management' settings](/security/#preventing-fraudulent-payments) if your PSP is Worldpay

You can also check your PSP settings by selecting **Settings** from your account in the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services).
