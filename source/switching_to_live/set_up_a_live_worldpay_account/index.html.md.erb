# Connect your live account to Worldpay

This is part of [going live](/switching_to_live/#go-live).

From 1 August 2020, you must connect your live GOV.UK Pay account either the [GOV.UK's contracted payment service provider (PSP)](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_stripe_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-stripe) or Government Banking's contracted PSP.

Government Banking's contracted payment service provider (PSP) is currently Worldpay. You must be a central government or health sector organisation to use Government Banking's contracted PSP.

You must be an admin on your GOV.UK Pay account to connect to Worldpay.

## Check your Worldpay account

Make sure your Worldpay account is both:

- an admin account
- using the Worldpay Corporate Gateway, not the Worldpay Business Gateway

## Switch to Production Mode for your merchant code

Sign in to your [Worldpay
account](https://secure.worldpay.com/sso/public/auth/login.html) and select your merchant code.

If __Test Mode__ is at the bottom of the left-hand menu, switch to __Production Mode__. Worldpay uses the term 'production' for live accounts.

## Connect your Worldpay account to GOV.UK Pay

1. Select your live account from the [__My services__ page](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services) in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool.

2. Select __Your PSP - Worldpay__.

3. In your Worldpay account, select __Account__ and the __Profile__ tab, then your merchant code if you're asked for one.

4. Copy the __Merchant Code__ value from the __Identification__ section of your Worldpay account into the __Merchant code__ field in your GOV.UK Pay account.

5. Copy the __New Username__ value from your Worldpay account into the __Username__ field in your GOV.UK Pay account.

6. If you see a checkbox labelled __Disable Original XML Username__, select the checkbox, then select __Save Profile__ at the bottom.

7. If you have not set your XML password for this merchant code before, set it by selecting the pencil icon next to __XML Password__ and choosing a password.

    If you've set your XML password before but you cannot remember it, you can set a new password. But you must add the new password to your other services that use this Worldpay account, or they'll stop working.

    You should follow the guidance about [choosing and storing passwords](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/top-tips-for-staying-secure-online/password-managers) from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).

8. Confirm your password by selecting __Add new password__, then __OK__.

9. Save the password by selecting the pencil icon again, then __Complete__, then __OK__.

10. Enter your XML password into the __Password__ field in your GOV.UK Pay account.

11. Go to the __Payment service__ section of your Worldpay account.

12. Set __Capture delay (days)__ to __Off__ (not __0__).

    If you do not do this, you may take money from your users before they've confirmed their payment.

13. Contact Worldpay if you want to take payments higher than the amount in __Maximum Transaction Amount__.

14. In your GOV.UK Pay account, select __Save credentials__.
