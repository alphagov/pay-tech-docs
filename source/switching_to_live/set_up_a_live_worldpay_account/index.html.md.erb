# Connect your live account to Worldpay

Before you start, you must:

- read about [what to do first](/switching_to_live/#before-you-start)
- [request a live GOV.UK Pay account](/switching_to_live/#1-request-a-live-gov-uk-pay-account)

You must also be an admin on your GOV.UK Pay account.

## Check your Worldpay account

Make sure your Worldpay account is both:

- an admin account
- using the Worldpay Corporate Gateway - not the Worldpay Business Gateway

## Switch to Production Mode for your merchant code

Sign in to your [Worldpay
account](https://secure.worldpay.com/sso/public/auth/login.html) and select your merchant code.

If __Test Mode__ is at the bottom of the left-hand menu, switch to __Production Mode__. Worldpay uses the term 'production' for live accounts.

## Connect your Worldpay account to GOV.UK Pay

1. Select your live account from the [__My services__ page](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services) in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool.

2. Select __Your PSP - Worldpay__.

3. In your Worldpay account, select __Account__, then the __Profile__ tab. Select your merchant code if you're asked for one.

4. Copy the __Merchant Code__ value from the __Identification__ section of your Worldpay account into the __Merchant code__ field in your GOV.UK Pay account.

5. Copy the __New Username__ value from your Worldpay account into the __Username__ field in your GOV.UK Pay account.

6. If you see a checkbox labelled __Disable Original XML Username__, select the checkbox then
select __Save Profile__ at the bottom.

7. If you have not set your XML password for this merchant code before, set it by selecting the pencil icon next to __XML Password__ and choosing a password. Confirm by selecting __Add new password__, then __OK__. Save the password by selecting the pencil icon again, then __Complete__, then __OK__.

    > If you've set your XML password before but you cannot remember it, you can set a new password. But you must add the new password to your other services that use this Worldpay account, or they'll stop working.

8. Enter your XML password into the __Password__ field in your GOV.UK Pay account.

9. In the __Payment service__ section of your Worldpay account, set __Capture delay (days)__ to __Off__ (not __0__). If you do not do this, you may take money from your users before they've confirmed their payment.

10. In your GOV.UK Pay account, select __Save credentials__.

## Set up your Worldpay 'Merchant Channels'

You must set up your Worldpay 'Merchant Channels' so Worldpay can notify GOV.UK Pay about payment events.

In your Worldpay account, select __Integration__ then the __Merchant Channel__ tab.

### Merchant Channels

Set __Active__ to:

- __no__ in the __email__ row
