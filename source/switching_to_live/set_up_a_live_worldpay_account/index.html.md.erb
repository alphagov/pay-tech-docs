# Connect your live account to Worldpay

This is part of [going live](/switching_to_live/#go-live).

Government Banking's contracted payment service provider (PSP) is currently Worldpay. You must be a central government or health sector organisation to use Government Banking's contracted PSP.

You must be an admin on your GOV.UK Pay account to connect to Worldpay.

## Check your Worldpay account

Make sure your Worldpay account is both:

- an admin account
- using the Worldpay Corporate Gateway, not the Worldpay Business Gateway

## Switch to Production Mode for your merchant code

Sign in to your [Worldpay
account](https://secure.worldpay.com/sso/public/auth/login.html) and select your merchant code.

If __Test Mode__ is at the bottom of the left-hand menu, switch to __Production Mode__. Worldpay uses the term 'production' for live accounts.

## Connect your Worldpay account to GOV.UK Pay

1. Select your live account from the [__My services__ page](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services) in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool.

2. Select __Your PSP - Worldpay__.

3. In your Worldpay account, select __Account__ and the __Profile__ tab, then your merchant code if you're asked for one.

4. In your Worldpay account, copy the __Merchant Code__ value from the __Identification__ section. Paste this value into the __Merchant code__ field in your GOV.UK Pay account.

5. In your Worldpay account, copy the __New Username__ value. Paste this value into the __Username__ field in your GOV.UK Pay account.

6. In your Worldpay account, if you see a checkbox labelled __Disable Original XML Username__, select the checkbox and then select __Save Profile__ at the bottom.

7. In your Worldpay account, if you have not set your XML password for this merchant code before, set it by selecting the pencil icon next to __XML Password__ and choosing a password.

    If you've set your XML password before but you cannot remember it, you can set a new password. But you must add the new password to your other services that use this Worldpay account, or they'll stop working.

    You should follow the guidance about [choosing and storing passwords](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/top-tips-for-staying-secure-online/password-managers) from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).

8. Confirm your password by selecting __Add new password__, then __OK__.

9. Save the password by selecting the pencil icon again, then __Complete__, then __OK__.

10. In your Worldpay account, copy your XML password. Paste this password into the __Password__ field in your GOV.UK Pay account.

11. Go to the __Payment service__ section of your Worldpay account.

12. Set __Capture delay (days)__ to __Off__ (not __0__).

    If you do not do this, you may take money from your users before they've confirmed their payment.

13. Contact Worldpay if you want to take payments higher than the amount in __Maximum Transaction Amount__.

14. In your GOV.UK Pay account, select __Save credentials__.

## Enable 3DS2 (3DS Flex)

Once you have connected your Worldpay account to GOV.UK Pay, Worldpay will send you your 3DS Flex credentials. You can also find your 3DS credentials in [Worldpay’s Merchant Admin Interface](https://secure.worldpay.com/sso/public/auth/login.html?serviceIdentifier=merchantadmin) by selecting **INTEGRATION** and then **3DS Flex**.

3DS Flex is a Worldpay product that enables 3DS2 payment authentication. You must turn on 3DS Flex to take payments using GOV.UK Pay.

1. In the GOV.UK Pay admin tool, select the account you want to set up on the **Overview** page.

1. In **Your PSP**, enter your 3DS Flex credentials.

1. Select **Save credentials**.

1. Select **Turn on 3DS Flex**.

## Set up your Worldpay 'Merchant Channels'

You must set up your Worldpay 'Merchant Channels' so Worldpay can notify GOV.UK Pay about payment events.

In your Worldpay account, select __Integration__ then the __Merchant Channel__ tab.

### Set up ‘Merchant Channels’

You must make the following changes in both the __Merchant Channels (Production)__ and __Merchant Channels (Test)__ sections.

Set __Active__ to:

- __no__ in the __email__ row
- __yes__ in the __http__ row
- __no__ in the __shopper email__ row

In the __http__ row, set:

- __Content__ to __xml__
- __Address__ to `https://notifications.payments.service.gov.uk/v1/api/notifications/worldpay`
- __Method__ to __POST__
- __Client certificate__ to __no__

### Set up ‘Merchant Channel Events’

In both the __Merchant Channel Events (Production)__ and __Merchant Channel Events (Test)__ sections, select the following in the __http__ row.

- __SHOPPER_REDIRECTED__
- __SENT_FOR_AUTHORISATION__
- __AUTHORISED__
- __ERROR__
- __CANCELLED__
- __CAPTURED__
- __CAPTURE_FAILED__

- __SENT_FOR_REFUND__
- __REFUNDED__
- __REFUNDED_BY_MERCHANT__
