# Before you switch to live 

Before you start taking live payments, you should: 

* [provide organisation information](#provide-organisation-information) to GOV.UK Pay 
* request a [live GOV.UK Pay account](#request-a-live-gov-uk-pay-account)
* make sure that the right people on your
team [know how to report an emergency](#emergency-contact-details)

GOV.UK Pay currently supports live gateways for the PSPs
[ePDQ](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_epdq_account),
[Smartpay](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_smartpay_account) and
[Worldpay](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account).  

## Provide organisation information

Card networks require organisation information to be displayed on payment
pages. Before you make an account live, you need to provide this information
to GOV.UK Pay.

1. Sign in to your [GOV.UK Pay
   account](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login).
1. Select __Switch service__.
1. For the test account you want to make live, select __Organisation
   details__. 
1. Complete the __Name__ and __Address__ fields.
1. Select __Save__. 

> Make sure the organisation is the entity that has a contract with the
> payment service provider.

## Request a live GOV.UK Pay account

1. Sign in to your [GOV.UK Pay
   account](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login).
1. Select __Switch service__.
1. For the test account you want to make live, select __Manage team members__
   on the dashboard. 
1. Copy the full page URL, for example   `https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/service/23f0eb425a9569988b99b5bb641a541d`.

Send the GOV.UK Pay team the page URL, your service name, and what type of PSP
account you want to make live. You can email the team at
[govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

The GOV.UK Pay team will change your account to live within one business day.

When your account is live, it will appear in the __Switch service__ page
labelled as a __Live card account__.

## Support

Before you switch to live, you may find it helpful to read about the [support
the GOV.UK Pay team provides](/support_contact_and_more_information/#support).

While GOV.UK Pay is in beta, our team can provide hands-on support to you as you
make your service live if you require it. 

### Emergency contact details

Before you switch to live, make sure your team knows
how to report an emergency.

In the event of an emergency, first check the [status
page](https://payments.statuspage.io). Select __Subscribe to updates__ to get
email notifications whenever GOV.UK Pay creates or updates an incident.

When you sign up for GOV.UK Pay, the team will give you emergency contact
details. You can use these to reach the appropriate support team in case of an
urgent problem. For example, if you suspect that fraudulent transactions are
being made on your account.
