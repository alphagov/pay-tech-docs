# Connect your live account to Stripe

This is part of [going live](/switching_to_live/#go-live).

From 1 August 2020, you must connect your live GOV.UK Pay account to either GOV.UK's contracted payment service provider (PSP) or [Government Banking's contracted PSP](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-worldpay).

Stripe is GOV.UK Pay's contracted PSP.

After you request a live GOV.UK Pay account, we'll contact you to verify your organisation’s identity.

We'll also give you a link where you can provide your organisation's:

* bank sort code and account number
* address
* telephone number
* VAT number
* company registration number if you've [registered your company](https://www.gov.uk/limited-company-formation/register-your-company)

You must also provide us with the name, date of birth and home address of someone who's authorised to sign contracts on behalf of your organisation, also known as a ‘[responsible person](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/what-being-a-responsible-person-means/)’.

GOV.UK Pay only stores your organisation's address and telephone number. GOV.UK Pay passes all other information to Stripe without storing that information. Stripe then processes and stores that information.

Once you’ve provided us with your details, your live account is connected to Stripe. Continue with the next steps to [going live](/switching_to_live/#4-choose-which-card-types-to-accept).
