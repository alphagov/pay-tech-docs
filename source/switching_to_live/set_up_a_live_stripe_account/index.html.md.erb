# Connect your live account to Stripe

This is part of [going live](/switching_to_live/#go-live).

From 1 August 2020, you must connect your live GOV.UK Pay account to either GOV.UK's contracted payment service provider (PSP) or [Government Banking's contracted PSP](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-worldpay).

Stripe is GOV.UK Pay's contracted PSP.

After you request a live GOV.UK Pay account and confirm you will connect it to Stripe, we'll review your request to go live. After we approve your request, you need to add more details about your service and organisation.

You must add:

* your organisation's bank details
* the name, date of birth, home address, telephone number, and email address of someone who has the authority to sign a contract on behalf of your organisation (called your ['responsible person'](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/what-being-a-responsible-person-means/))
* your organisation's VAT number (if your organisation has one)
* the name, date of birth and email address of the director of your service (or someone at director level)
* your company registration number (if your organisation has one)

To add these details:

1. Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login).

1. Select the service going live from the **Overview** page - services that need these additional details are labelled **INFORMATION NEEDED**.

1. On your service dashboard, select **Add details** in the **Important** banner, or select **Settings** in the navigation.

1. Follow the on-screen instructions.

GOV.UK Pay only stores your organisation's address and telephone number. GOV.UK Pay passes all other information to Stripe without storing that information. Stripe then processes and stores that information.

Once youâ€™ve provided us with your details, your live account is connected to Stripe. Continue with the next steps to [going live](/switching_to_live/#4-choose-which-card-types-to-accept).
