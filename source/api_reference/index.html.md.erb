# API reference

The base URL for the GOV.UK Pay API is
`https://publicapi.payments.service.gov.uk/`.

The same base URL is used for test and live accounts. The API key you use
determines if actions are treated as test payments, or processed as real payments.

The API is based on REST principles. It returns data in JSON format, and uses
standard HTTP error response codes.

You can [get started with the API quickly](/quick_start_guide/#quick-start). Make sure you enter your test API key to avoid generating real payments.

When we add new properties to the JSON responses, the GOV.UK Pay API version number will not change. You should develop your service to ignore properties it does not understand.

## API browser and Swagger file

For more detailed information on each API action, you can:

- open the <a href="https://govukpay-api-browser.cloudapps.digital/" target="blank">API browser</a>
- look at the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/pay-publicapi/blob/master/swagger/swagger.json" target="blank">API Swagger file</a>

You can also generate a client library from the Swagger file using the <a href="http://editor.swagger.io/" target="blank">Swagger editor</a>. This may be an easier way for you to integrate your service with GOV.UK Pay than writing a client library from scratch.

## Allowing traffic to our API

If you're connecting to the GOV.UK Pay API from a secure network, we recommend using a web proxy like [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/) to allow traffic to our base URL.

Do not add an allow list of IP addresses to your firewall, because GOV.UK Pay’s IP addresses will change regularly. Read more about [why GOV.UK does not support allow lists of IP addresses](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2017/01/03/a-whitelisting-approach-for-cloud-apis/).

## Authentication

GOV.UK Pay authenticates API calls with [OAuth2 HTTP bearer
tokens](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750). These are easy to
use and contain only your API key.

When you make an API call, you need to use an “Authorization” HTTP header to
provide your API key, with a “Bearer” prefix. For example:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-API-KEY-HERE>
```

## Payment status lifecycle

The following diagram gives an overview of the payment status lifecycle and the
possible outcomes, excluding for delayed capture payments:

<%= image_tag "/images/payment-states.svg", { :alt => '' } %>

You can check the status of a payment using the <a
href="https://govukpay-api-browser.cloudapps.digital/#get-a-payment"
target="blank">Find payment by ID</a> API call.

A successful response includes ``status`` and ``finished`` values:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
  <th><code>status</code></th>
  <th>Meaning</th>
  <th nowrap><code>finished</code></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> created </td>
    <td> Payment created. Your user has not yet visited <code>next_url</code>. </td>
    <td> false </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> started </td>
    <td> Your user has visited <code>next_url</code> and is entering payment details. </td>
    <td> false </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> submitted </td>
    <td> Your user has submitted payment details but has not yet selected <b>Confirm</b>. </td>
    <td> false </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> capturable </td>
    <td> The payment is a [delayed capture](/delayed_capture/#delay-taking-a-payment), and your user has submitted payment details and selected <b>Confirm</b>. </td>
    <td> false </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> success </td>
    <td> Your user successfully completed the payment. </td>
    <td> true </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> failed </td>
    <td> Your user attempted to make a payment but the payment did not complete. </td>
    <td> true </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> cancelled </td>
    <td> Your service cancelled the payment using an API call or the GOV.UK Pay admin tool. </td>
    <td> true </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> error </td>
    <td> Something went wrong with GOV.UK Pay or the underlying payment service provider. <a href="/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us">Contact us.</a> </td>
    <td> true </td>
  </tr>

The general format of JSON error response bodies is:

```javascript
{
  "code": "PXXXX",
  "description": "Message explaining the error"
}
```

These error descriptions are intended for developers, not your users.

Some errors may contain additional fields , such as `field`.

#### Fix a P0920 API error

If you receive a P0920 API error code, our firewall blocked your request.

To fix a P0920 API error, make sure your API request:

- has a `Content-Type: application/json` header
- uses `application/json` in the `Accept` header if you're using an `Accept` header
- uses `https` in the `return_url`, not `http`
- does not use invalid characters like `<`, `>`, `|`, `"` or `\`
- does not have an empty request body if you're making a `POST` request

### Errors caused by payment statuses

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

| Error code | Meaning | Cause |
|------------|---------|-------|
| P0010 | Payment method rejected | Payment rejected due to payment method selected, or payment information entered. For example, failed fraud check, a 3D Secure authentication failure, or your user has insufficient funds in account. |
| P0020 | Payment expired | Payment was not confirmed and completed within 90 minutes of being created. If the payment was already authorised, GOV.UK Pay will send a cancellation to the payment provider. |
| P0030 | Payment cancelled by your user | Your user selected **Cancel payment** during the payment journey. If the payment was already authorised, GOV.UK Pay will send a cancellation to the payment provider. |
| P0040 | Payment was cancelled by your service | Your service cancelled the payment. |
| P0050 | Payment provider returned an error | Multiple possible causes, for example a configuration problem with the payment provider, or incorrect credentials. [Contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us), quoting the error code. |

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

You can see which payments have status-related error codes using the GOV.UK
Pay admin tool or directly using the API.

#### Use the admin tool

1. Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/).

2. Select __Transactions__.

3. Use the __Payment status__ dropdown to find payments with error statuses. For example, “Declined”.

#### Use the API

You can use the API to examine the `state` object in a payment’s API response.

For example:

```
{
  "amount": 2000,
  "state": {
      "status": "failed",
      "finished": true,
      "message": "Payment expired",
      "code": "P0020"
  },
}
```

## Rate limits

Per second, you can make:

- up to 15 `POST` requests to [create a payment](/making_payments/#creating-a-payment)
- up to 15 `POST `requests to [capture a delayed payment](/delayed_capture/#delay-taking-a-payment)
- up to 15 other `POST` requests

GET requests are also rate-limited, but at a very high level. In the future,
we will publish an official rate limit for GET requests.

If you exceed the rate limit, this will return HTTP status code “429” (Too
many requests) and error code P0900. After a second, you’ll be able to retry
your attempt in a reasonable way. For example, using exponential backoff.

[Contact
us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us)
if you would like to discuss rate limiting applied to your service account, or
give us feedback.
