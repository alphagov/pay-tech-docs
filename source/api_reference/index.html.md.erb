# API reference

GOV.UK Pay is based on REST principles with endpoints returning data in JSON format, and standard HTTP error response codes. The platform API allows you to:

- initiate and complete payments
- view the event history for individual payments
- view transactions within a specified time period
- provide full or partial refunds

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

## API overview

>The base URL for the API is __https://publicapi.payments.service.gov.uk/__

The same base URL is now used for testing and live. The API key you use determines if the actions are treated as sandbox test payments or processed as real payments.

For full details of each API action, see the API Browser:

- <a href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/docs/versions/1.0.2/resources/general" target="blank">General functions</a> (link opens in new window)
- <a href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/docs/versions/1.0.2/resources/payment-id" target="blank">Payment ID functions</a> (link opens in new window)

You can also use our interactive <a href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/gov-uk-pay-api/versions/1.0.2//" target="blank">API Explorer</a> (link opens in new window) to try out API calls and view responses.

See the [Quick Start Guide](/quick_start_guide/#quick-start-guide) section for how to set up the API Explorer. Make sure you enter your sandbox API key to avoid generating real payments.



## API authentication

GOV.UK Pay authenticates API calls with OAuth2 HTTP bearer tokens. These are easy to use and consist of one component: your API key. Bearer tokens are specified in [RFC 6750](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750).

When making an API call, you’ll need to add your API key to an "Authorization" HTTP header and prefix it with "Bearer ". This is an example of how a header would look.

```text
Authorization: Bearer 2o9bkusxaicha5c9gnsj790of7asggo1feraoufbai4a
```


## Payment status lifecycle

This diagram gives an overview of the payment status lifecycle and the possible outcomes.

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pay-govuk-documentation/pay-transaction-states.png)

You can check the status of a given payment using the <a href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/gov-uk-pay-api/versions/1.0.2/v1/find-payment-by-id" target="blank">Find payment by ID</a> API call (link opens in new window).

The response will include a ``status`` value as described in the table below, and a true/false ``finished`` value which indicates if the status can change.

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

| status value | Meaning                                                                                        | finished value |

## HTTP status codes

You will encounter typical HTTP success and error response codes when using the GOV.UK Pay API. Generally any:

- 100 code is informational
- 200 code indicates you’ve been successful
- 300 code indicates a redirection
- 400 code indicates a client error (your error)
- 500 code indicates a server error (something went wrong on the GOV.UK Pay end)

These are the known status codes you are likely to receive:

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

|Common status code| Meaning|
|------------------|--------|
|200 | Payment information request succeeded |
|201 | Payment has been created |
|204 | The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content |
|400 | The server cannot process the request due to a client error, e.g. missing details in the request or a failed payment cancellation|
|401 | Required authentication has failed or not been provided|
|404 | The resource you want cannot be found|
|412 | Precondition failed: e.g. mismatch in expected refund amount available|
|422 | Unprocessable entity obtained on a request validation|
|429 | Too many requests. Request rate is above the rate limit|
|Any 500 error | Something is wrong with GOV.UK Pay - please contact us|

## API error codes

### API errors caused by an API call

When your API call results in an error, you will receive these API codes in the body of the response.

This is the format of the general JSON error response body:

```javascript
{
  "code": "PXXXX",
  "description": "Message explaining the error"
}
```

Note that the description provided is written to be informative to you, the developer, and is not intended for the end user.

Also note that extra keys, e.g `field`, may be provided on a per-error basis.

These error codes provide more information about why a request failed.

### API errors caused by payment statuses

The API error codes in this section are driven by payment status. You can see which payments have these error codes using either of the following methods:

- Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin site](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/), go to _Transactions_ and click on a payment with a "failed", "cancelled" or "error" status.
- use the API to look at the `state` object in a payment's API response, for example:

    ```
    {
        "amount": 2000,
        "state": {
            "status": "failed",
            "finished": true,
            "message": "Payment expired",
            "code": "P0020"
        },
    }
    ```

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

| Error code | Meaning | Cause |
|------------|---------|-------|
| P0010 | Payment method rejected | Payment rejected due to payment method selected or payment information entered, for example, failed fraud check, a 3D Secure authentication failure, or the user does not have enough money in account |
| P0020 | Payment expired | Payment was not confirmed and completed within 90 minutes of being created; if the payment was already authorised, GOV.UK PAY will send a cancellation to the payment provider |
| P0030 | Payment cancelled by user | User clicked on the "Cancel payment" button during the payment journey; if the payment was already authorised, GOV.UK PAY will send a cancellation to the payment provider |
| P0040 | Payment was cancelled by your service | Your service cancelled the payment |
| P0050 | Payment provider returned an error | Multiple possible causes, for example a configuration problem with the payment provider, or incorrect login credentials; contact us, quoting the error code |

## API rate limits

POST requests to the GOV.UK Pay API are rate-limited to 15 requests per second, for each government service. 

GET requests are also rate-limited, but at a very high level. In the future, we will publish an official rate limit for GET requests.

If you exceed the rate limit, this will return HTTP status code "429" (Too many requests) and error code P0900. After a second, you'll be able to retry your attempt in a reasonable way. For example, using exponential backoff.

Please [contact us](https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/support_contact_and_more_information/#support-contact-and-more-information) if you would like to discuss rate limiting applied to your service account, or give us feedback.
