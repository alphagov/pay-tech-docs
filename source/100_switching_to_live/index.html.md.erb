# Switching to live

Please read this information carefully.

Follow these steps to switch your account from ‘test’ to ‘live’. You should
only do this when you’ve finished [testing with your sandbox
account](/testing_govuk_pay/#testing-gov-uk-pay), and you’re confident that
[your integration is working](/integration_details/#integration-details).

This guidance is for services that have integrated
with the GOV.UK Pay API or which use the [payment
link](/payment_links/#payment-links) functionality.

Please read the guidance on what to do [before you switch to live](/switching_to_live/before_you_switch_to_live/#before-you-switch-to-live) first.

GOV.UK Pay currently supports
[ePDQ](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_epdq_account),
[Smartpay](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_smartpay_account) and
[Worldpay](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account) live gateways.
