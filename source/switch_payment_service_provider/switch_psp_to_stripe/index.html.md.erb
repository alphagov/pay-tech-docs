# Switch payment service provider to Stripe

This guidance tells you how to switch your payment service provider (PSP) to Stripe.

You must be a GOV.UK Pay admin user to switch PSP. To check if you are an admin user for a service:

1. Select **View team members** or **Manage team members** next to the service on the **Overview** page.

2. If your email address is listed under **Administrators**, you are an admin user.

## Prepare to switch to Stripe

Email [govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) asking to switch your PSP to Stripe on all services for your organisation, or list out specific services.

The GOV.UK Pay support team will confirm when we’ve enabled the switch PSP feature for your service.

To switch to Stripe, you’ll need:

* the name, date of birth, home address, telephone number, and email address of someone who has the authority to sign a contract on behalf of your organisation (called your [‘responsible person’](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/what-being-a-responsible-person-means/))
* your organisation's bank details
* your organisation's VAT number (if your organisation has one)
* your company registration number (if your organisation has one)
* your organisation's URL
* the name, date of birth and email address of the director of your service (or someone at director level)
* a debit or credit card to make a refundable payment to test your service

Before switching, read the:

* [GOV.UK Pay contract](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/policy/download/contract-for-non-crown-bodies) (if you are a non-Crown organisation)
* [Memorandum of Understanding](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/policy/download/memorandum-of-understanding-for-crown-bodies) (if you are a Crown organisation)
* [Stripe Connected Account Agreement](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/policy/download/stripe-connected-account-agreement).

To get to the **Switch payment service provider** page:

1. Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login).

2. Select the service you want to switch from the **Overview** page - services you can switch are labelled **LIVE - SWITCH PSP**

3. On your service dashboard, select the ‘**...how to switch to Stripe**' link in the banner at the top of the page, or select **Settings** in the navigation.

4. In **Settings**, select **Switch PSP** from the side navigation.

## Switch to Stripe

You need to repeat the following process for each service you want to switch.

### Provide your details and test the integration with Stripe

To test the integration between Stripe and GOV.UK Pay, you need to make a live payment. This step makes sure you have integrated your GOV.UK Pay and Stripe accounts correctly.

The live payment is £2.00 and is refundable. Your new Stripe account will be debited a small transaction fee.

1. Select **Provide your bank details**.

1. Enter your sort code and account number.

1. Select **Save and continue** to return to the **Switch payment service provider (PSP)** page.

1. Select **Provide details about your responsible person**.

1. Complete the **Name**, **Home address**, **Date of birth**, **Telephone number**, and **Email address** sections.

1. Select **Save and continue**.

1. Select **Provide your organisation’s VAT number**.

1. Enter your organisation’s VAT number.

1. Select **Save and continue**.

1. Select **Provide your company’s registration number**.

1. If your organisation has a company registration number, select **Yes** and enter your company registration number.

1. If your organisation does not have a company registration number, select **No**.

1. Select **Save and continue**.

1. Select **Add organisation URL**.

1. Enter your organisation's URL.

1. Select **Add information about the director of your organisation**.

1. Enter the details of the director (or someone at director level) for your service.

1. Select **Make a live payment to test your Stripe PSP** - you will need a debit or credit card for this step.

1. Select **Continue to live payment**.

1. Enter your card details.

1. Select **Continue**. You’ll be returned to the **Switch payment service provider** page.

A **Success** banner confirms the payment and you can also find it in the **Transactions** list.

If your service uses the GOV.UK Pay API for reporting, you may want to check the test transaction appears correctly in your systems.

<%= warning_text('Your existing PSP is still processing this service’s payments. You have not switched your PSP yet.') %>

### Switch PSP to Stripe

You’re ready to switch once you’ve provided your details in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool, and made a live payment to test the integration.

Users making payments as you switch are unaffected. Your old PSP will process their payments.

To switch, select **Switch to Stripe**. A **Success** banner confirms the switch.

You have now switched PSP to Stripe. Stripe will process new payments.

## Refund payments after switching to Stripe

After you switch to Stripe, you can still refund old payments through your old PSP.

For now, GOV.UK Pay will maintain an integration with your old PSP to allow your service to process refunds through your old PSP. However, if your contract with your old PSP expires, or your old PSP stops operating, it will not be possible to refund payments through GOV.UK Pay.

If you cannot refund a payment through your old PSP, find an alternative like a cheque or bank transfer.

Refund payments by signing into the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login), selecting your service, and choosing the **Transactions** tab. Alternatively, you can use [the GOV.UK Pay API](https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/refunding_payments/#refund-a-payment).
