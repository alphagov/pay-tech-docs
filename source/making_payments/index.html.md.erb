# Take a payment

This section tells you how to take a payment using the GOV.UK Pay API.

When your user makes a payment, your service should supply a `reference`. If
possible, this should be a unique identifier for the payment. If your
organisation already has an existing identifier for payments, you can use it
as this `reference`.

Your service will also need to supply a
[`return_url`](#choose-the-return-url-and-match-your-users-to-payments). This
is a URL that your service hosts for your user to return to, after their
payment journey on GOV.UK Pay ends.

## Creating a payment

The call to create a payment with the GOV.UK Pay API is:

`POST  /v1/payments`

For example:

```javascript
{
  "amount": 14500,
  "reference" : "12345",
  "description": "Pay your council tax",
  "return_url": "https://your.service.gov.uk/completed",
  "delayed_capture": false,
  "metadata": { 
    "ledger_code": "AB100",
    "an_internal_reference_number": 200
  },
  "email": "sherlock.holmes@example.com",
  "prefilled_cardholder_details": {
    "cardholder_name": "Sherlock Holmes",
    "billing_address": {
        "line1": "221 Baker Street",
        "line2": "Flat b",
        "postcode": "NW1 6XE",
        "city": "London",
        "country": "GB"
    }
  },
  "language": "en",
  ...
}
```

### API call parameters

#### amount

`amount` is the amount in pence. In the example, the payment is for £145.

The amount must be a number data type rather than a string.

The minimum amount is one pence plus your Payment Service Provider's (PSP's) transaction fee. To see your PSP's transaction fee, check your contract by either:

- signing into the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login) if you use Stripe
- [contacting Government Banking](mailto:serviceteam.gbs@hmrc.gov.uk) if you are using Government Banking's contracted PSP, which is currently Worldpay
- asking your PSP

The maximum amount is either:

- 10,000,000 pence (£100,000)
- 500,000 pence (£5,000) if you use Government Banking

Your PSP may set a lower maximum amount. Check with your PSP if you cannot make payments up to the maximum amount.

If you need to take payments above the maximum amount, either:

- [contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/)
- [contact Government Banking](mailto:serviceteam.gbs@hmrc.gov.uk) if you are using Government Banking's contracted PSP, which is currently Worldpay

#### delayed_capture

You can use this field to [delay taking a payment](/delayed_capture/#delay-taking-a-payment).

#### description

`description` is a human-readable description of the payment. This is shown to your user on the payment pages and to your staff on the GOV.UK Pay admin tool.

The description must be no longer than 255 characters, and must not contain URLs.

#### email and prefilled_cardholder_details

You can use the `email` and `prefilled_cardholder_details` parameters to [prefill some of the fields on the **Enter card details** page](/optional_features/prefill_user_details/#prefill-payment-fields).

#### language

You can use the `language` field to [use Welsh on your payment pages](/optional_features/welsh_language/#use-welsh-on-your-payment-pages).

#### metadata

You can use the `metadata` parameter to [add custom metadata](/custom_metadata/#add-custom-metadata).

#### reference

`reference` is the reference number you wish to associate with this payment.

The reference number does not need to be unique, and must not:

- be longer than 255 characters
- contain URLs

The format is variable. If you have an existing format, you can keep using it if your values are no longer than 255 characters.

#### return_url

This is a URL that your service hosts for your user to return to, after their payment journey on GOV.UK Pay ends.

You must [use HTTPS for your `return_url`](/security/#https), but you can use
HTTP with test accounts.

The URL must be no longer than 2,000 characters, and must not be JSON-encoded because backslashes are invalid characters in the API.

## Receiving the API response

Example response:

```json
{
  "created_date": "2020-03-03T16:17:19.554Z",
  "state": {
    "status": "created",
    "finished": false,
  },
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://publicapi.payments.service.gov.uk/v1/payments/hu20sqlact5260q2nanm0q8u93",
      "method": "GET"
   },
    "next_url": {
      "href": "https://publicapi.payments.service.gov.uk/secure/bb0a272c-8eaf-468d-b3xf-ae5e000d2231",
      "method": "GET"
    },
    ...
  },
  "amount": 14500,
  "reference" : "12345",
  "description": "Pay your council tax",
  "return_url": "https://your.service.gov.uk/completed",
  "payment_id": "hu20sqlact5260q2nanm0q8u93",
  "payment_provider": "worldpay",
  "provider_id": "10987654321",
  ...
}
```

The response to the ‘Create new payment’ API call will include the URL for the payment. You can get this from either:

* the `Location` response header
* the `self` section of `_links` in the JSON body

The URL contains the GOV.UK Pay `paymentId`, which is automatically generated and identifies the payment. A GET request to this URL will return information about the payment and its status.

Your service will need to store the `paymentId` (or the full URL) for each new payment you create. This is so you can check the status of these payments later.

Read more about [reporting](/reporting/#report-on-a-payment) and [payment flow](/payment_flow/#how-gov-uk-pay-works).

The response will also include the ``next_url`` to which you should direct your
user to complete their payment.

<%= warning_text('Do not expose the `next_url` to anyone other than your paying user. Anyone in possession of the `next_url` could hijack your user’s payment.') %>

### API response fields

#### \_links

The `_links` object includes `href` and `method` fields that you can use to make API requests related to the payment. Use the fields in:

- `self` to [get information about the payment](/reporting/)
- `events` to [get the payment's events](/reporting/#get-a-payment-s-events)
- `refunds` to [get all refunds for the payment](/refunding_payments/#get-all-refunds-for-a-single-payment)
- `cancel` to [cancel the payment](/making_payments/#cancel-a-payment-that-s-in-progress)

The `_links` object also includes a `next_url_post` object,  For example:

```json
"next_url_post": {
   "type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
   "params": {
       "chargeTokenId": "bb0a272c-8eaf-468d-b3xf-ae5e000d2231"
   },
   "href": "https://www.pymnt.uk/secure",
   "method": "POST"
},
```

You can use the `href` and `chargeTokenId` to make a `POST` API request to `next_url`, instead of a `GET` API request.
 
#### created_date

`created_date` is when you created the payment, in [ISO
8601 format](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/date-times-and-time-stamps-standard).

#### payment_provider

`payment_provider` is the name of your payment service provider (PSP), or `sandbox` if you're using a test ('sandbox') account.

#### provider_id

`provider_id` is the unique ID that your PSP generated for this payment. 

#### state

Use `state` to see the [status of the payment](/api_reference/#payment-status-lifecycle).

## Track the progress of a payment

You can track the progress of a payment using the [Find payment by ID](/reporting/#get-information-about-a-single-payment) call.

The status of the payment will pass through several states until it either
succeeds or fails. Read more about the [payment status lifecycle](https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/api_reference/#payment-status-lifecycle).

## Choose the return URL and match your users to payments

For security reasons, GOV.UK Pay does not add the `paymentId` or outcome to
your `return_url` as parameters.

You can match your users with payments with an encrypted cookie, or by creating a
secure random ID:

### Use an encrypted cookie

You can use an encrypted cookie containing the payment ID from GOV.UK Pay. Your
service should issue this when a payment is created, before sending your user
to `next_url`. Your users will not be able to decrypt an encrypted cookie, so a
malicious user could not alter the payment ID and intercept other users’
payments.

### Create a secure random ID

You can create a secure random ID, such as a UUID, and include this as part of
the `return_url`. You should use a different `return_url` for each payment.
Malicious users will be unable to guess securely generated UUIDs.

If you use this method, you should store your IDs safely. For example, in a
datastore mapped to the payment ID just after a payment is created.

<%= warning_text('Make sure the way you match your returning users to payments is tamper-proof. <br><br> For example, don’t store the payment ID in an unencrypted cookie or rely on a `return_url` parameter that isn’t secret (like the payment ID or reference).') %>

## Accepting your users when they return

If your user is directed to the `return_url`, they could have:

 * paid successfully

 * not paid because their card was rejected or they selected cancel

 * not paid because your service (via the API) cancelled the payment in progress

 * not paid because of a technical error

Your service should use the API to check the payment status when your user
reaches the `return_url`, and provide an appropriate response based on the final
status of the payment attempt.

## When your user does not complete their payment journey

Your user may close their browser or lose internet connectivity in the middle of
their payment journey on GOV.UK Pay. In this event, your user will not be
redirected back to your service.

You can still [check the status of these
payments](/payment_flow/#check-the-status-of-a-payment), but you should be
aware GOV.UK Pay will allow your user 90 minutes to complete their payment before
it expires. You can only be certain of the payment’s status after this time.

If a [payment fails](/payment_flow/#payment-failure), GOV.UK Pay will not
allow your user to attempt the payment again with alternative card details. In
this situation your user would need to return to the service to retry the
payment. Your service should account for this.

## Cancel a payment that’s in progress

Your user can select a link on the payment page to cancel a payment that’s in
progress. Alternatively, a service can make the following API call for a given
`paymentId`:

`POST /v1/payments/paymentId/cancel`

A `204` response indicates success. Any other response indicates an error.

### Find out if you can cancel a payment

Use a GET request against a single payment to find out if you can cancel it:

`GET /v1/payments/paymentId`

If the JSON response body contains a `"cancel"` field (in the `_links` object)
that’s not `null`, you can cancel the payment. For example:

```
"cancel": {
  "href": "https://publicapi.payments.service.gov.uk/v1/payments/{paymentId}/cancel",
  "method": "POST"
}
```
