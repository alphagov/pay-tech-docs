# Take a Direct Debit payment

You can sign up for the Direct Debit pilot if you want to take recurring payments.

You can take payments whenever you need to. You can take the same amount or a different amount each time.

You cannot automatically schedule payments. If you need to take regular payments, you should create your own scheduler to send API calls on a set schedule.

Direct Debit is not currently available to central government departments in England or the NHS.

[Contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) if you want to know more or to sign up for our pilot.
