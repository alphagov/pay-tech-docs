# Take a Direct Debit payment

You cannot take Direct Debit payments using GOV.UK Pay at the moment.

We plan on implementing Direct Debit payments in the future.

You can find more information about our plans for recurring payment methods, including Direct Debit payments, on the [GOV.UK Pay Roadmap](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/roadmap/).
