# Set up how your services link to GOV.UK Pay services

Each GOV.UK Pay service can take payments from one or more of your services.

GOV.UK Pay services are free, and there's no limit to how many you can create.

## Link your services to a combined GOV.UK Pay service

You can use one GOV.UK Pay service to take payments for a group of your services, if you need to easily manage the following across the whole group:

- your staff members' access in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool
- your account settings, for example which card types you accept

1. [Create one GOV.UK Pay service](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services/create).
2. Use API keys or payment links from the GOV.UK Pay service in all of the services in your group.

You will not be able to give your services different names or send payments to different bank accounts.

If you need to know which service each payment came from when you [report on payments](/reporting), you can:

- add different [reference numbers](/making_payments/#reference)
- add different [descriptions](/making_payments/#description)
- use [custom metadata](/custom_metadata/#add-custom-metadata)
- use different API keys
- use different [payment links](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/)

## Link your services to different GOV.UK Pay services

You should [create a separate GOV.UK Pay service](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services/create) for each of your services if you need to do any of the following:

- give each service its own name on the GOV.UK Pay payment pages
- report on each service's payments separately
- [send each service's payments to different bank accounts](/account_structure/set_up_where_payments_go/#send-payments-to-different-bank-accounts)
- give your staff members access to each service separately in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool
- manage the settings for each service separately
