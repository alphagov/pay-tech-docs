# Setting up multiple services

If you have more than one online service, you can set up your GOV.UK Pay accounts and payment service provider (PSP) accounts so it's easier to manage your payments and services.

You can set up:

- [which bank accounts your payments go to](set_up_where_payments_go)
- [how your services link to GOV.UK Pay services](set_up_where_services_link_to)

Find out more about [reconciling payments](/reporting).
