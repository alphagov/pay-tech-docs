# Setting up multiple services

If you have more than one service, you can set up GOV.UK Pay so it's easier to manage your payments and services.

You can set up:

- [which bank accounts your payments go to](set_up_where_payments_go)
- [how your services link to GOV.UK Pay services](set_up_where_services_link_to)

Find out more about [reconciling payments](/reporting).
