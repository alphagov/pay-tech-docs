# Versioning

You can use [our API explorer](https://gds-payments.gelato.io/) to use the
latest version of our API.

If you want to update to our latest API, make sure you test your code before
committing to the change.

When we add new properties to the JSON responses, the GOV.UK Pay API version
number will not change. You should develop your service to ignore properties
it does not understand.

We'll release new and dated versions of the public API if we remove JSON
values in a backwards-incompatible manner.

Our version number will be updated in the URL when there is a release. All
releases will be marked with full version numbers.

Weâ€™ll support each version of the early beta GOV.UK Pay API for at least 1
month after we issue an upgrade notice. As the API matures, we may increase
this support period to 3 or 6 months.
