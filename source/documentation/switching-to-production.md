# Switching to live

Once you have finished testing with your sandbox account, here are the steps you will need to take to switch over from testing to live.

Unless stated otherwise, this section applies both to services that have integrated with the GOV.UK Pay API, and to services that use [payment links](/payment_links/#payment-links) functionality.

## Set up GOV.UK Pay account

### Request a live account

Request a live account by emailing GOV.UK Pay at [govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](a href="mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk"). Once you have a live account, it will appear in the “My Services” section and be clearly labelled as a “Live” account.

### Complete organisation details

Payment card schemes require the details of the organisation taking payment to be shown on payment pages where the user enters card details. This information is displayed in the payment page footer. Note that:

- the organisation must be the entity that has a contract with the PSP
- organisation details are not specific to test or live accounts, meaning that if you complete the details for your test account then they will be transferred to your live account automatically

To complete your organisation details:

1. Go to the [GOV.UK Pay admin site](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login).
1. Sign in to your GOV.UK Pay account.
1. Go to _Switch service_ > _Organisation details_.
1. Complete the _Organisation name_ and _Organisation address_ fields on this page.
1. Click _Save_ to see the following message: "Organisation details updated".

### Set up live account credentials

To set up your live account credentials:

1. Go to the [GOV.UK Pay admin site](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login).
1. Sign in to your GOV.UK Pay account.
1. Go to _My Services_ and click on the live service you want to set up.
1. Go to _Settings > Account Credentials > Edit credentials_.
1. Complete the fields on this page; these will vary depending on which live service you use.

#### ePDQ

Complete the fields on the Account credentials page:

- _PSP ID_ - enter your PSP ID for ePDQ
- _Username_ - enter the API user’s username
- _Password_ - enter the API user’s password
- _SHA-IN passphrase_ - this passphrase is created on the [_Data and origin verification_ page](/#set-up-checks-for-e-commerce-amp-alias-gateway)
- _SHA-OUT passphrase_ - this passphrase is created on the [_All transaction submission modes_ page](/#set-up-security-for-request-parameters)
- click _Save credentials_ to go back to the _Account Credentials_ page

Complete the fields on the Account credentials page:

## Generate API Key

Refer to the documentation for instructions on how to [generate an API key for use with your live code](/quick_start_guide/#generate-api-key-for-api-explorer).

GOV.UK currently supports Worldpay, Barclays ePDQ and Smartpay live gateways. Setup instructions are explained in the [Worldpay](/switching_to_production/#worldpay-setup), [ePDQ](/switching_to_production/#epdq-setup) and [Smartpay](/switching_to_production/#smartpay-setup) sections.

The API endpoint for live is now the same as for testing: https://publicapi.payments.service.gov.uk/

>This only applies if your service is integrating with the GOV.UK Pay API. It does not apply to [payment links](/payment_links/#payment-links).


## Worldpay setup

You must change some settings in your Worldpay account to get it ready for live use.

1. Sign in to Worldpay and in your Worldpay profile, set *Capture delay* to "Off".<br /><br />![](images/pay-worldpay-autocaptureoff.png)
2. Still in Worldpay, go to *Profile > Merchant Channel* and set the endpoint for HTTP notifications from Worldpay to GOV.UK Pay to _https://notifications.payments.service.gov.uk/v1/api/notifications/worldpay_
<br /><br />
Use the same URL for Test and Live channels within Worldpay. The completed settings should look like this:
<br /><br />![](images/worldpay-settings1.png)

### Worldpay setup for 3D Secure

## Emergency contact details

Your service manager should have been given details of emergency contact methods to reach our support team in case of an urgent problem (for example, if you suspect that fraudulent transactions are being made on your account).

Before you enter live, you should make sure that the right people on your team know how to report an emergency.

## Integrating with existing reporting systems

If you’re a beta partner, the GOV.UK Pay team will hold technical workshops with you to discuss how to integrate the reporting from GOV.UK Pay with your own financial systems.
