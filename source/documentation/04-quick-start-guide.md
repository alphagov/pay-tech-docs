# Quick start guide

The GOV.UK Pay platform is based on REST principles with endpoints returning data in JSON format, and standard HTTP error response codes. The platform API allows you to:

- initiate and complete payments
- issue refunds
- view the event history for individual payments
- view transactions within a specified time period
<br /><br />
This section explains how to get started with our API Explorer and make a test API call.

## Generate API Key for API Explorer

1. Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin site](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/) with the sandbox account login details you received.

1. Click on the API key section, then click **Generate a new key**.

<br /><br />Your API key will be shown on the screen for you to copy.<br /><br /> ![](images/NewKeygenerate+image+3.png)


<blockquote>You must store your API keys away securely. Make sure you never share this key in publicly accessible documents or repositories, or with people who should not be using the GOV.UK Pay API directly. [Read our security section](/security/#security) for more information on how to keep your API key safe.</blockquote>

## API Explorer setup

The quickest way to learn about the API is to use the <a href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/" target="blank">API Explorer</a> (link opens in new window) with the API key that you just created.

1. Go to the <a href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/" target="blank">API Explorer</a> (link opens in new window), sign in, and click the “Add API Key” button.<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
1.  In the resulting pop-up, enter the following values:
  + For **API Key**, enter "[YOUR-API-KEY]" (do not include the quotation marks), replacing [YOUR-API-KEY] with the actual value of your sandbox API key. You do not need to put the "Bearer: " prefix which is required when calling the API from code; the API Explorer adds that automatically.
  + For **Label**, enter "Authorization" (do not include the quotation marks).

> Make sure you are using an API key from your sandbox account on the admin site, not the live account.

## Making a test API call

You will now make a test API call to GOV.UK Pay by creating a new payment. This is the call your service will make when 
initiating a payment using GOV.UK Pay.

1. To test the API Explorer, select General from the API Explorer **Resource** dropdown menu. Select <a href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/gov-uk-pay-api/versions/1.0.2/general/create-new-payment" target="blank">Create new payment</a> (link opens in new window) from the API Explorer **Action** dropdown menu. Click on the **Body** tab lower down to see an example JSON body that you would send when creating a payment.

```javascript
{
"amount": 12000,
"reference": "12345",
"description": "New passport application",
"return_url": "https://service-name.gov.uk/transactions/12345"
}
```

As well as details of the payment, you'll notice that you need to send a ``return_url`` when creating a payment. The reason for this is that users go to GOV.UK Pay hosted pages to actually make their payment.
The ``return_url`` is the URL of a page on your service that the user will be redirected to after they have completed their payment (or payment has failed).

1. Click the green **Send Request** button.

1. If the API Explorer is set up correctly, you will receive a 201 Created response with a JSON body, confirming that the payment was created. Note that the JSON includes a ``next_url`` link. This URL is where your service should redirect the user for them to make their payment.

## Follow end user payment journey

1. Go to the ``next_url`` with your browser. You'll see the payment screen. Refer to the [Testing GOV.UK Pay](/testing_govuk_pay/#testing-gov-uk-pay) section to find a mock credit card number that you can enter to simulate a payment in the sandbox environment. For the rest of the details, enter some test information, bearing in mind that:
    + the expiry date must be in the future and in the format MM/YYYY
    + the postcode must be valid

1. Submit the payment.

## View transaction at GOV.UK Pay Admin site

1. Go to the [service admin site](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/) and select **Transactions**.
