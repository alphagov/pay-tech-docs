# Before you start

To start using the GOV.UK Pay platform, you'll need:

- a digital service that needs to process payments
- a [GOV.UK Pay account](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/create-service/register) 
- a service team with the development skills to build the technical integration with GOV.UK Pay; refer to the [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/what-each-role-does-in-service-team#roles-your-team-must-have) for more information
  
Check the [Getting Started guide](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/getstarted/) to ensure that your team is ready to start using the GOV.UK Pay platform.

Make sure you’re also familiar with the government guidance on [deploying new software](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/deployment.html).

>If you are new to the GOV.UK Pay API, we recommend you take a look at the quick start guide, which explains how to access the API and start exploring what it can do.

## How long will it take?

The time taken to integrate will vary depending on team and capability; for example, it took a single developer five days to integrate a Home Office service with GOV.UK Pay.
