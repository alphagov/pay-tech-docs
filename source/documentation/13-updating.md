# Updating to the latest API

You can use [our API explorer](https://gds-payments.gelato.io/) to use the latest version of our API. We’ll also send you an email to let you know about any new versions we release. 

If you want to update to our latest API, make sure you test your code before committing to the change.

> We’ll support each version of the early beta GOV.UK Pay API for at least 1 month after we issue an upgrade notice. As the API matures, we may increase this support period to 3 or 6 months.
