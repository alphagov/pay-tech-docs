# About GOV.UK Pay

GOV.UK Pay makes it easy for departments and agencies across government to take payments. It provides a standard set of GOV.UK branded pages which can be incorporated into a service to take payments, and an admin console which enables services to administer and process payments taken through GOV.UK Pay. Much of GOV.UK Pay’s functionality can be incorporated into existing case management tools via our API.

GOV.UK Pay is currently in beta development. The payment pages are responsive and work on both desktop and mobile.

The platform can connect your government service to different [payment service providers (PSPs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_service_provider).

During beta, GOV.UK Pay will support credit and debit card payments only. Over time, further payment methods, such as direct debit or eWallet, will be added.

Your service only needs to integrate with GOV.UK Pay once to let your users make credit and debit card payments. When GOV.UK Pay is expanded to accept other payment methods, your service will not have to undertake any new integration. Using GOV.UK Pay will save your team time compared to implementing support for multiple PSPs and payment methods from scratch.

The platform currently supports one-off payments (like fees, fines or licence payments). In the future, it will also support recurring payments, for example, monthly tax payments.

The GOV.UK Pay platform does not currently support payments to cardholders, for example, payments of benefits, or grants. The platform only supports taking payments, or providing refunds.

There are ten departments and agencies currently partnering with the platform:

- Ministry of Justice
- Home Office
- Disclosure and Barring Service
- Office of the Public Guardian
- HM Courts and Tribunals Service
- Disclosure Scotland 
- Foreign and Commonwealth Office 
- Ministry of Defence
- Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport
- Department for International Trade

## How much does it cost?

There is no charge to use GOV.UK Pay. You will still need to pay your PSP's transaction fees.
