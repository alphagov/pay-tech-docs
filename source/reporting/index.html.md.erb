# Reporting 

You can extract reporting information from GOV.UK Pay manually, or via the
API.

## Manual reporting

You can use your [GOV.UK Pay admin
account](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login) to export
transaction information in a CSV file. 

1. For the account you want reporting information for, select __Transactions__
in the __Dashboard__ page.

2. Optionally, filter transactions using the available search criteria. 

3. Select __Download all transaction details as a CSV file__. 

You can process CSV files using spreadsheet software.

## Reporting via the GOV.UK Pay API 

Before reading this section, you should be familiar with the "[Making
payments](/making_payments)" section. 

You can get data from the GOV.UK Pay API in a format suitable for automatic
processing. For example, you could develop software to query the GOV.UK Pay
API for payment data periodically, and import the data into your finance
system. This could remove routine manual operations from your workflow, and
lead to significant cost savings for your organisation.

You can use the GOV.UK Pay API to:

* get information about a single payment
* generate a list of payments matching search criteria  

## Get information about a single payment

`GET /v1/payments/paymentId`

1. Sign in to <a href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/"
   target="blank">the API Explorer</a> (link opens in new window).  
2. Under __Resource__, select __{Payment Id}. 
3. Under __Action__, select <a
   href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/gov-uk-pay-api/versions/1.0.2/general/"
   target="blank">__Find payment by ID__</a> (link opens in new window). 
   
If the payment exists, the JSON response body to this
API call contains a `"state"` field. You can use this information when
designing a service.  

For example, the response for a successful payment contains:

```
  "state": {
    "status": "success",
    "finished": true
    },
```

With a successful payment, you know that the user can continue their journey
through your service.

For a valid request, the JSON response body to this API call also contains
other useful information. For example, if a user has gone far enough in their
payment journey, the `"card_details"` section contains information that they
have entered when making a payment: 

```
  "card_details": {
    "last_digits_card_number": "1111",
    "first_digits_card_number": "100002",
    "cardholder_name": "Sherlock Holmes",
    "expiry_date": "12/21",
    "billing_address": {
      "line1": "221 Baker Street",
      "line2": "Flat b",
      "postcode": "NW16XE",
      "city": "London",
      "country": "GB"
    },
```

## Generate a list of payments (search payments) 

`GET /v1/payments`

1. Sign in to <a href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/"
   target="blank">the API Explorer</a> (link opens in new window).  
2. Under __Resource__, select __General__. 
3. Under __Action__, select <a
   href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/gov-uk-pay-api/versions/1.0.2/general/"
   target="blank">__Search payments__</a> (link opens in new window). 

### Search criteria 

An example search request:

`GET
/v1/payments?from_date=2018-10-01T13:30:00Z&to_date=2018-10-14T15:00:00Z&reference=12345&state=success)`

Some of the query parameters you can use to search for payments are: 

* `reference`
* `email`
* `state` 
* `card_brand` 
* `first_digits_card_number`
* `last_digits_card_number`
* `cardholder_name`

If you search for a specific payment, all criteria you use must match.
Otherwise, that payment will not be returned in the results. 

If your request has no query parameters, the API will return all payments. 

#### Filter by date

You can use the following query parameters to filter payments by date:

* `from_date` - the start date for payments to be searched, inclusive 
* `to_date` - the end date for payments to be searched, exclusive 

These take inputs based on a subset of ISO8601. For example, a
valid input would be `2015-08-13T12:35:00Z`.

#### Pagination

You can use the following query parameters for pagination: 

* `display-size` - defaults to `500` 
* `page` - defaults to `1`

These must be a positive integer. For example, for the following search:

`GET
/v1/payments?from_date=2018-10-01T13:30:00Z&to_date=2018-10-14T15:00:00Z)`

If there were 1543 payments in the response, you could paginate this as follows:

`GET
/v1/payments?from_date=2018-10-01T13:30:00Z&to_date=2018-10-14T15:00:00Z&display-size=500&page=1)`

This would return payments 501-1000.
