# Use the API to take MOTO payments

If you have an integration with the GOV.UK Pay API, you can create MOTO payments through our API. Your paying user gives you their payment details by calling your service or sending their details through the post. An agent enters the paying user’s payment details and completes the payment.

Make sure you've [turned on MOTO (telephone or post) payments on your service](/moto_payments/#turn-on-moto-payments) first.

## Create a MOTO payment using the GOV.UK Pay API

<%= warning_text('If your payment service provider is Worldpay, you must use an API key from your MOTO service.')%>

1. Use the [`POST /v1/payments` endpoint](/making_payments/#creating-a-payment) to request a payment and include `"moto": true` in the request body:
  
    ```json
    {
      "amount": 14500,
      "reference" : "12345",
      "description": "Pay your council tax",
      "return_url": "https://your.service.gov.uk/payment_complete_page",
      "moto": true
    }
    ```
2. Go to the `next_url` included in the response to your API request.
3. On the **Enter card details** page, enter your user’s payment details. The **Enter card details** page does not have a billing address field, even if you've turned on billing address collection on your service.
4. On the **Confirm your payment** page, confirm the payment details. You will not need to do a 3D Secure confirmation.

### Taking a payment by post

If you're taking a payment by post, make sure you've collected your user's:

  - card number
  - card expiry date
  - card security code
  - name from their card
  - email address - if you’ve [turned on user email address collection](/integrate_with_govuk_pay/#collecting-your-users-39-billing-addresses)

## Hide users' card information

When taking payments over the phone, you can hide the card information of paying users. When a call centre agent enters a user’s card information, the details are hidden like a password. This protects the paying user’s card information from anyone that can see the call centre agent’s screen. You can hide:

* the card number
* the card verification value (CVV) or card verification code (CVC)

To hide or unhide this information, you need Administrator permissions for your MOTO service. To see if you're an admin for a service, select the service from **My services**, then select **Settings**. Under **About your service**, select **Team members**. Your email address will be under the role you have for this service.

This change takes immediate effect, so you should tell your service team staff before changing these settings.

1. Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk).
1. Select the service you want to change.
1. Go to **Settings**.
1. Under **Payments**, select **Card payments**.
1. Under **MOTO security**, go to either **Hide card numbers** or **Hide card security codes** and select **Change**.
1. Select either **Hidden** or **Visible** and then **Save changes**.
