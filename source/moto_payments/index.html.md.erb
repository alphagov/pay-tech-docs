# Take payments over the phone or by post (‘MOTO’)

You can use GOV.UK Pay to take payments over the phone or by post. These payments are called Mail Order / Telephone Order (MOTO) payments. 

This kind of payment does not have a section for billing addresses because they are not needed. 3D Secure does not apply to MOTO payments.

There are 3 ways to take MOTO payments through GOV.UK Pay. You can:

* [use the admin tool to take MOTO payments](/moto_payments/moto_admin_tool)
* [use the API to take MOTO payments](/moto_payments/moto_api)
* [use an external system to send card details through the API](/moto_payments/moto_send_card_details_api)

You need to turn on MOTO payments on your GOV.UK Pay account before you can take payments over the phone or through the post.

## Turn on MOTO payments

<%= warning_text('If your PSP is Worldpay, you\'ll need to have separate services set up for MOTO and non-MOTO payments.')%>

### Services in sandbox and 'not live yet' modes - turn on MOTO payments

Email [govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) and ask us to turn on MOTO payments on a service that's in sandbox or 'not live yet' mode.

You do not need to provide any supporting information yet.

### Live services - turn on MOTO payments

You must make sure you comply with the latest version of PCI DSS before we turn on MOTO payments for your live service.

Before emailing GOV.UK Pay to turn on MOTO payments, make sure that both the part of your organisation that processes cardholder data and any suppliers or delivery partners:

* comply with the latest version of PCI DSS
* hold a valid Attestation of Compliance (AOC)

If you take a live MOTO payment and your service does not comply with PCI DSS, you could be fined.

Once you are sure your organisation complies with the latest version of PCI DSS, turning on MOTO payments depends on if your PSP is Stripe or Worldpay.

#### Stripe - turn on MOTO payments on a live account

Email [govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) to tell us that:

* both your organisation and any suppliers or delivery partners comply with the latest version of PCI DSS
* both your organisation and any suppliers or delivery partners hold a valid AOC
* you would like to take MOTO payments on your live service

We’ll email you to let you know when we’ve turned on MOTO payments.

#### Worldpay - turn on MOTO payments on a live account

1. Create a new MOTO service that is separate from your online payments service - to do this, sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk) and select **Add a new service**.

1. You need to process MOTO payments on a separate MOTO merchant code to the one you use for online (non-MOTO) payments. If you do not already have a merchant code for MOTO payments, ask for one by contacting Government Banking. You’ll use this merchant code when you [connect your new service to your PSP](https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/switching_to_live/#go-live).

1. Email [govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) to confirm you and any suppliers or delivery partners comply with the latest version of PCI DSS. In the same email, let us know that would like to take MOTO payments on your account. 

We’ll email you to let you know we’ve turned on MOTO payments.

You can still [take online payments](https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/making_payments/) through your non-MOTO service.
