# Take payments over the phone or by post (‘MOTO’)

You can use GOV.UK Pay to take payments over the phone or by post. These payments are called Mail Order / Telephone Order (MOTO) payments. 

This kind of payment does not have a section for billing addresses because they are not needed. 3D Secure does not apply to MOTO payments.

There are 3 ways to take MOTO payments through GOV.UK Pay. You can:

* [use the admin tool to take MOTO payments](/moto_payments/moto_admin_tool)
* [use the API to take MOTO payments](/moto_payments/moto_api)
* [use an external system to send card details through the API](/moto_payments/moto_send_card_details_api)

You need to enable MOTO payments on your GOV.UK Pay account before you can take payments over the phone or through the post.

## Enable MOTO payments

<%= warning_text('If your PSP is Worldpay, you\'ll need to have separate services set up for MOTO and non-MOTO payments.')%>

You can enable MOTO payments on a test account or a live account.

### Test account - enable MOTO payments

Email [govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) and ask us to enable MOTO payments on your test account.

You do not need to provide any supporting information yet.

### Live account - enable MOTO payments

How you enable MOTO payments on a live account differs depending on whether you use Stripe or Worldpay as your PSP.

#### Stripe - enable MOTO payments on a live account

1. Make sure you comply with the [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss).

1. Email [govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) to confirm you are PCI DSS compliant and would like to take MOTO payments on your account. We’ll email you to let you know we’ve enabled MOTO payments.

#### Worldpay - enable MOTO payments on a live account

1. Create a new MOTO service that is separate from your online payments service - to do this, sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk) and select **Add a new service**.

1. You need to process MOTO payments on a separate MOTO merchant code to the one you use for online (non-MOTO) payments. If you do not already have a merchant code for MOTO payments, ask for one by contacting Government Banking. You’ll use this merchant code when you [connect your new service to your PSP](https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/switching_to_live/#go-live).

1. Email [govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) to confirm you are PCI DSS compliant and would like to take MOTO payments on your account. We’ll email you to let you know we’ve enabled MOTO payments.

You can still [take online payments](https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/making_payments/) through your non-MOTO service.
