# Take a payment over the phone (‘MOTO’ payments)

We can set up your GOV.UK Pay account so you can fill in GOV.UK Pay payment pages with your users’ details.

This means you can take payments:

- over the phone
- by post

These payments are also known as Mail Order / Telephone Order (MOTO) payments.

You cannot take MOTO payments:

- if your payment service provider (PSP) is SmartPay
- through a [payment link](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/) - [contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) if you'd like us to develop this feature
- if you are not PCI compliant

[Contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) if you'd like us to investigate taking MOTO payments through payment links.

## Set up MOTO payments

You can set up MOTO payments on a test account or a live account.

MOTO payment screens are the same as online payment screens, excluding the following:

- MOTO payments screens do not have a section for billing address
- [Strong Customer Authentication](/set_up_3dsecure/#set-up-strong-customer-authentication-3ds1-and-3ds2) does not apply to MOTO payments

## Set up MOTO payments on a test account

[Contact GOV.UK Pay support](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) to ask us to enable MOTO payments on your test account.

You do not need to provide us with any supporting information at this time.

## Set up MOTO payments on a live account

How you set up MOTO payments on a live account differs depending on what payment service provider (PSP) you use.

### Set up MOTO payments on a live account with Worldpay or ePDQ

If you use Worldpay or ePDQ, you must:

- use a service for MOTO payments that’s separate to your online payments service
- process MOTO payments on a specific MOTO merchant code

1. Create a separate MOTO payments service if you do not have one already by signing in to your [GOV.UK Pay account](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/) and going to __My services__. Select __Add a new service__ to add a new service for MOTO payments to your account.

1. If you do not already have a MOTO merchant code, ask for a new code by contacting your PSP or Government Banking as required. You will use this merchant code when you [connect your new service to your PSP](/switching_to_live/#go-live).

1. Send your [PCI DSS Self Assessment Questionnaire](/security/#payment-card-industry-pci-compliance) and service name to [GOV.UK Pay support](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

We will review your PCI DSS compliance. Your PCI DSS compliance requirements are different for MOTO payments compared to online payments.

When we’re satisfied that you’ve met your PCI DSS compliance requirements, we will enable MOTO payments in your service. You can then take MOTO payments.

### Set up MOTO payments on a live account with Stripe

Send your [PCI DSS Self Assessment Questionnaire](/security/#payment-card-industry-pci-compliance) and service name to [GOV.UK Pay support](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

We will review your PCI DSS compliance. Your PCI DSS compliance requirements are different for MOTO payments compared to online payments.

When we’re satisfied that you’ve met your PCI DSS compliance requirements, we will enable MOTO payments in your service. You can then take MOTO payments.

## Create a MOTO payment

Follow these steps to create and complete the MOTO payment.

1. If your PSP is Worldpay or ePDQ, make sure you're using an API key from your MOTO service in [your services](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services).

2. [Create a payment](/making_payments/#creating-a-payment) with the GOV.UK Pay API, and include `moto: true` in the request body.

3. Go to the [`next_url`](/payment_flow/#making-a-payment) included in the body of the response to your API call.

4. Fill in your user’s information on the **Enter card details** page.

    The **Enter Card Details** page will not have a billing address field, even if you've enabled collecting billing addresses.

5. Confirm the payment on the **Confirm your payment** page.

    You will not need to do a 3D Secure confirmation.

If you're taking a payment by post, make sure you've collected your user's:

  - card number
  - card expiry date
  - card security code
  - name from their card
  - email address - if you’ve [enabled collecting your users’ email addresses](/integrate_with_govuk_pay/#collecting-your-users-39-billing-addresses)

## Hide users' card information

When taking payments over the phone, you can hide the following sensitive user card information from your service team staff:

- the full 16 digit card number
- the card verification value (cvv) or card verification code (cvc)

To hide or unhide this information, you must have admin permissions for your service.

This change takes immediate effect, so you should tell your service team staff before changing these settings.

1. Sign into the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/). Make sure you are in the right service.
1. Go to __Settings__ and then __Security__.
1. Go to either __Hide card numbers__ or __Hide card security codes__ and select __Change__.
1. Select either __Hidden__ or __Visible__ and then __Save changes__.

## Create an online payment

After we enable MOTO payments in your account, you can still create payments where your user fills in their details themselves.

[Create a payment](/making_payments/#creating-a-payment) with the GOV.UK Pay API using:

- `moto: false` in the request body
- an API key from your normal service in [your services](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services), if your PSP is Worldpay or ePDQ
