# Take a digital wallet payment

You can enable [Google Pay](https://pay.google.com/intl/en_uk/about/) and [Apple Pay](https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-pay/) to take payments from your users.

This is only available to services with a [live Worldpay account](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-worldpay).

Digital wallet payments work with both [integrating with the GOV.UK Pay API](/integrate_with_govuk_pay/#integrate-with-the-gov-uk-pay-api) or using [payment links](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/).

## Enable Apple Pay

1. Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/).

2. Under **Services**, select the service where you want to enable Apple Pay.

3. Select __Settings__.

4. Change the **Apple Pay** setting.

You do not need to ask Worldpay to enable Apple Pay in your Worldpay account.

## Enable Google Pay

To enable Google Pay, you must enter a unique Google Pay merchant ID into your GOV.UK Pay account.

You get a Google Pay merchant ID from your Worldpay merchant admin interface.

1. If required, speak to your Worldpay account manager to upgrade your Worldpay merchant admin interface to include Google Pay functionality.

1. Sign in to your [Worldpay merchant admin interface](https://secure.worldpay.com/sso/public/auth/login.html).

1. Go to __Integration__ and select the __Pay with Google__ tab.

1. Under __Generate unique merchant ID__, select __Generate__.

1. Copy the generated merchant ID.

1. Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/).

1. Under **Services**, select the service where you want to enable Google Pay.

1. Select **Settings**.

1. Go to the **Google Pay** setting, select **On** and enter the merchant ID.

## Strong Customer Authentication (3D Secure)

Apple Pay requires your users to authenticate digital wallet transactions using a secure method such as a fingerprint scan. Your Apple Pay users do not need to complete a Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) method such as 3D Secure separately.

Google Pay supports, but does not require, your users to authenticate digital wallet transactions using a secure method. Your users who do not use Google Pay’s secure authentication may have to complete SCA separately.

See the [GOV.UK Pay page on Apple Pay and Google Pay](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/apple-pay-and-google-pay/) for more information.

## Restrictions of digital wallet payments

GOV.UK Pay cannot apply [corporate card surcharges](/corporate_card_surcharges/#add-corporate-card-fees) to digital wallet transactions made with a corporate card.

GOV.UK Pay stores different cardholder information for digital wallet payments than standard card payments. There are further differences between payments made through Apple Pay and Google Pay.

If you rely on cardholder information as part of your service, you should not collect this information through GOV.UK Pay. Cardholder information in digital wallet payments is unreliable because of how Google Pay and Apple Pay handle payment cards.
