# Take a digital wallet payment

You can enable [Google Pay](https://pay.google.com/intl/en_uk/about/) and [Apple Pay](https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-pay/) to take payments from your users.

This is only available to services with a [live Worldpay account](/switching_to_live/set_up_a_live_worldpay_account/#connect-your-live-account-to-worldpay).

Digital wallet payments work with both [integrating with the GOV.UK Pay API](/integrate_with_govuk_pay/#integrate-with-the-gov-uk-pay-api) or using [payment links](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/).

## Enable Apple Pay

1. Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/).

2. Under **Services**, select the service where you want to enable Apple Pay.

3. Select __Settings__.

4. Change the **Apple Pay** setting.

You do not need to ask Worldpay to enable Apple Pay in your Worldpay account.

## Enable Google Pay

To enable Google Pay, you must enter a unique Google Pay merchant ID into your GOV.UK Pay account.

You get a Google Pay merchant ID from your Worldpay merchant admin interface.

1. If required, speak to your Worldpay account manager to upgrade your Worldpay merchant admin interface to include Google Pay functionality.

1. Sign in to your [Worldpay merchant admin interface](https://secure.worldpay.com/sso/public/auth/login.html).

1. Go to __Integration__ and select the __Pay with Google__ tab.

1. Under __Generate unique merchant ID__, select __Generate__.

1. Copy the generated merchant ID.

1. Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/).

1. Under **Services**, select the service where you want to enable Google Pay.

1. Select **Settings**.

1. Go to the **Google Pay** setting, select **On** and enter the merchant ID.

## Strong Customer Authentication (3D Secure)

Apple Pay requires your users to authenticate digital wallet transactions using a secure method such as a fingerprint scan. Your Apple Pay users do not need to complete a Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) method such as 3D Secure separately.

Google Pay supports, but does not require, your users to authenticate digital wallet transactions using a secure method. Your users who do not use Google Payâ€™s secure authentication may have to complete SCA separately.

See the [GOV.UK Pay page on Apple Pay and Google Pay](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/apple-pay-and-google-pay/) for more information.

## Restrictions

The GOV.UK Pay platform cannot apply [corporate card surcharges](/corporate_card_surcharges/#add-corporate-card-fees) to digital wallet transactions made with a corporate card.

When you look at a non-digital wallet transaction in your GOV.UK Pay account transactions list, you see the first 6 digits and last 4 digits of the card number. When you look at a digital wallet transaction in your GOV.UK Pay account transactions list, you only see the last 4 digits of the card number or digital wallet account number.

GOV.UK Pay does not collect or transfer any cardholder information during a digital wallet transaction, as this information is transferred directly between Apple or Google Pay and the payment service provider (PSP).

If you use cardholder information as part of your service, you should not collect this information through GOV.UK Pay, as we can only collect cardholder information to initiate a payment.

### Google Pay

If a user makes a payment with Google Pay, we cannot tell if they used a credit card or a debit card. This means:

- the `card_type` is `null` when you [get information about a payment](/reporting)
- you cannot restrict transactions to one type of card

You can still restrict transactions to one card scheme, like Visa.
