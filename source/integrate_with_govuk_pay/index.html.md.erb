# Integrate with the GOV.UK Pay API

Before you build an integration, your service team should have the necessary skills. You can refer to the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/what-each-role-does-in-service-team#roles-your-team-must-have) for more information.

This guidance is for technical architects or developers planning to integrate
their service with the GOV.UK Pay API. It describes:

* the requirements for your service’s backend
* what data you need to store and why
* typical data flows for using the GOV.UK Pay API in an integration
* when to release services to your users
* making sure that all payments are processed
* integrating with finance and accounting systems

## Service backend

Your service backend is server-side software. You should build this to:

* make a call to the GOV.UK Pay API to start the payment journey
* store information about user payment journeys in your datastore
* redirect your user to the `next_url` provided by GOV.UK Pay, where your user
will [enter their payment information and confirm their payment](/payment_flow/#making-a-payment)
* receive your user's request when they are redirected back to your service via the `return_url`, where your user will return [after they complete their payment](/payment_flow/#making-a-payment)
* identify your returning user via the session
* make a call to the GOV.UK Pay API to determine the outcome of the payment
* display information about the outcome of the payment and next steps to your user

## Datastore

You will likely need some kind of server-side datastore to record payment information for each payment journey. You should store:

* an ID or primary key
* the service your user requested
* the GOV.UK Pay `paymentId`
* the status of the payment
* the date and time the payment was started

## Finance and accounting systems

You may want to integrate your finance and accounting systems with GOV.UK Pay
using the API.

For example, you could automatically fetch data about the outcome of payment journeys. You could import that into your finance system so payments can be reconciled against bank transaction information.

If you [search payments using the API](/reporting/#search-payments) at the end of each day, you should run the search at least one hour after your `to_date`. This is because the API may not return up-to-date information about payment events from the last hour.

To help you reconcile payments, you can:

- [add custom metadata to payments](/custom_metadata/#add-custom-metadata)
- [contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#support) to change what appears on your bank statement - if you use Stripe

You could also connect a customer-relationship management (CRM) or case management system to GOV.UK Pay, so your staff can issue refunds from within your system.

Read more about [reporting](/reporting/#report-on-a-payment) and [refunding payments](/refunding_payments/#refund-a-payment).

### Receiving payments

The date you receive users’ payments into your account depends on your payment service provider's (PSP) minimum payout and payment times.

Your PSP only transfers money to you when the total of your users' payments is above your PSP's minimum payout.

If your PSP is Stripe:

- the minimum payout is £1
- money will reach your bank account within 2 working days of your user completing their payment
- money will take 3 working days to reach your account if your user completed their payment at the weekend or on a bank holiday

If your PSP is Stripe, you can sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login) to see:

- payments ('payouts') that Stripe has made to your bank account
- which of your users' payments are in each payout

If your PSP is Government Banking's contracted PSP (currently Worldpay), SmartPay or ePDQ, contact your PSP to find out your minimum payout and payment times.

#### Checking when your PSP sent a payment

If your PSP is Stripe, you can check when Stripe sent a payment to your bank account by making an API call to [get information about a payment](/reporting/#get-information-about-a-single-payment).

Example response:

```
"settlement_summary": {
  ...
  "settled_date": "2016-01-22",
}
```

where `settled_date` is either:

- the date Stripe sent the payment to your bank account as part of a group of payments (‘payout’)
- missing if Stripe has not yet sent the payment to your bank account

All dates are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

You can also sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login) to see your payout for each day, and which of your users’ payments are in each payout.

## The GOV.UK Pay API

The GOV.UK Pay API offers a set of operations to conduct and report on
payments. For more information:

- read our [API reference](/api_reference)
- use the <a href="https://govukpay-api-browser.cloudapps.digital/" target="blank">API browser</a>
- look at the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/pay-publicapi/blob/master/swagger/swagger.json" target="blank">Swagger file</a>

## When to release your service to your users

It's your responsibility to decide when to release your service to your users. This will depend on the nature of your service.

In some cases you may be comfortable releasing a service before a payment has been confirmed. For example, if you’re taking payments in advance because a user has an account with you.

In most cases, you’ll want to confirm that a payment has been completed before releasing the service to your users. Typically you’ll do this when your user visits the `return_url` on your service.

The following example UML sequence diagram shows a typical happy-path payment journey:

![Typical happy-path user payment sequence](/images/happy-path-sequence.svg)

## Identifying your user when they return to your service

We recommend using a cookie-based session to identify your user when they
return to your service. You could use either encrypted client side sessions,
or server-side sessions using session store.

We recommend that you do not encode any reference number or user-
specific information  in the `return_url`. For example, do not use
`/payment_12345` at the end of your `return_url`.

If you do, an attacker may be able to guess the reference in your
`return_url` and gain access to another user's personal information displayed
on your confirmation screen.

You must [use HTTPS for your `return_url`](/security/#https), but you can use
HTTP with test accounts.

## Make sure that all payments are processed

There are 2 failure cases which affect the design of your integration with
GOV.UK Pay:

* your user abandons their payment journey before completing it
* your user completes their payment successfully, but their network connection is
interrupted before they return to your service

In the happy-path scenario you want to release your service as quickly as
possible to your user, so you would check the payment outcome when your
`return_url` is visited.

However, in the failure cases, your user will never visit the `return_url`. Instead, you should either:

* make sure your service team can manually check payment outcomes in the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login)
* use an automatic mop-up job (recommended)

### Have your service team manually check the payment outcome

If your team manually checks payment outcomes before releasing payments to your users, you may have a low-volume service. This would always be the case if you are using [payment links](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/).

You should make sure your service team checks the outcomes of payments in the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login) before releasing the service to your users.

### Use an automatic mop-up job (recommended)

A ‘mop-up job’ provides the best guarantee that the failure cases are handled properly
and automatically. A mop-up job is a background process which checks the outcome of incomplete payment journeys.

In order to use a mop-up job, you need:

* a datastore which keeps track of incomplete payment journeys
* a server-side process which periodically checks the datastore for incomplete payment journeys, and queries the GOV.UK Pay API to determine the outcome

The following UML sequence diagram shows an example of an incomplete payment journey, and how a mop-up job would clean it up:

![A mop-up job acting on an incomplete payment journey](/images/incomplete-payment-journey-sequence.svg)

Your mop-up job should run frequently, for example every half an hour. The mop-up job should ignore payments made in the past 3 hours to avoid interfering with payments that are still being processed.

If the mop-up job finds ‘stale’ incomplete payment journeys then it’s likely your users have abandoned those payments. The mop-up job should call the GOV.UK Pay API to determine the [status of the payment](/api_reference/#payment-status-lifecycle).

## Collecting your users' billing addresses

You can enable or disable collecting your users’ billing addresses in your [GOV.UK Pay account](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login) __Settings__ screen.

This change can take up to 15 minutes to take effect.

If you collect your users' billing addresses in your service before you redirect them to GOV.UK Pay, you can [prefill the billing address field](/optional_features/prefill_user_details) on the __Enter card details__ page.

<%= warning_text('If you disable billing address collection, your service will receive a `null` `billing_address` object in API responses. <br><br> The `billing_address` object is inside the `card_details` object. <br><br> You should check if disabling billing address collection will affect your service‘s integration with GOV.UK Pay.') %>
