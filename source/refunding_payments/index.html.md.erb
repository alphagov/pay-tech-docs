# Refund a payment

You can refund all or part of a payment using the GOV.UK Pay API.

You can also refund a payment by signing into the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login).

Your user will receive the refund in the same account they originally paid from. You cannot refund a payment to another card or bank account.

## Check if you can refund a payment

Before refunding a payment, check if you can make a refund by using the API to [get information about the payment](/reporting/#get-information-about-a-single-payment) (`GET /v1/payments/{PAYMENT_ID}`).

The API response includes a `refund_summary` object containing details about:

* whether you can refund the payment (`status`)
* how much you can refund to the user, in pence (`amount_available`)
* how much you've already refunded to the user, in pence (`amount_submitted`)

This is an example of a `refund_summary` object for a completed £50 payment with no previous refunds:

```javascript
"refund_summary": {
  "status": "available",
  "amount_available": 5000,
  "amount_submitted": 0
}
```

This is an example of a `refund_summary` object for a completed £90 payment where £30 has already been refunded:

```javascript
"refund_summary": {
  "status": "available",
  "amount_available": 6000,
  "amount_submitted": 3000
}
```

If `status` is `available`, you can refund the payment.

You can see definitions, values, and the limits of every parameter and response attribute for this endpoint in our [API reference](/api_reference/single_payment_reference).

### status

|Status|Meaning|
|---|---|
|pending|You cannot refund the payment yet because your user has not completed the payment.|
|unavailable|You cannot refund the payment, usually because the payment failed.|
|available|You can refund the payment. Check how much you can refund in `amount_available`.|
|full|You cannot refund the payment because you've already refunded the full amount.|

## Creating a refund

`POST /v1/payments/{PAYMENT_ID}/refunds`

Replace `{PAYMENT_ID}` with the ID of the payment you are refunding.

In the body of your request, you must send:

* `amount` - the amount you want to refund your user, in pence
* `refund_amount_available` - the `amount_available` value you received when you checked if you could refund the payment

GOV.UK Pay will reject your refund request if `refund_amount_available` does not match the `amount_available` from `GET /v1/payments/{PAYMENT_ID}`.

This example requests refunds £20 of an available £50:

```javascript
{
  "amount": 2000,
  "refund_amount_available": 5000
}
```

You can see definitions and possible values of these parameters in our [API reference](/api_reference/refund_payment_reference).

### Response

After you send your request to refund a payment, you'll receive a response like this:

```javascript
{
  "amount": 2000,
  "created_date": "2019-09-19T16:53:03.213Z",
  "refund_id": "j6se0f2o427g28g8yg3u3i",
  "status": "submitted",
  ...
}
```

The response includes:

* the amount refunded to the user in pence (`amount`)
* when you created the refund (`created_date`)
* the unique ID GOV.UK Pay associated with this refund (`refund_id`)
* the status of the refund (`status`)

You can see full definitions of these response attributes in our [API reference](/api_reference/refund_payment_reference).

If GOV.UK Pay could not successfully create the refund, the JSON response will contain an [API error code](/api_reference/#gov-uk-pay-api-error-codes) and a description of the error.

## Checking the status of a refund

`GET /v1/payments/{PAYMENT_ID}/refunds/{REFUND_ID}`

Replace:

* `{PAYMENT_ID}` with the ID of the payment you're checking
* `{REFUND_ID}` with the ID of the refund you're checking

Example response:

```json
{
  "amount": 2000,
  "created_date": "2019-09-19T16:53:03.213Z",
  "refund_id": "j6se0f2o427g28g8yg3u3i",
  "status": "success",
  "settlement_summary": {
    "settled_date": "2019-09-21"
  }
}
```

This response contains:

* the amount refunded to the user (`amount`)
* when you created the refund (`created_date`)
* the unique ID GOV.UK Pay associated with this refund (`refund_id`)
* the status of the refund (`status`)
* when your payment service provider (PSP) refunded the payment, if your PSP is Stripe (`settlement_summary`)

You can see definitions and possible values of these attributes in our [API reference](/api_reference/refund_status_reference).

### status

The `status` attribute shows where the refund is in its lifecycle.

|status|Meaning|
|---|---|
|submitted|We've submitted your refund request to your PSP. Refunds do not have a `submitted` status if you're using your test ('sandbox') account.|
|success|Your PSP has successfully processed the refund.|
|error|Your PSP could not process the refund, usually because your user's payment card is cancelled or expired, or you do not have enough money in your account to refund your user.|

## Where your PSP takes the refund amount from

If your user's payment did not reach your bank account yet, your PSP will:

- cancel the payment, if your PSP is Stripe
- take the refund amount after the payment has reached your bank account, if your PSP is Worldpay

If the payment has reached your bank account, your PSP will take the refund amount from:

- the next payment or payments you receive from any of your users, if your PSP is Stripe
- your bank account, if your PSP is Worldpay

If your PSP is Stripe, you can see when Stripe took the refund by making an API call to [check the status of a refund](/refunding_payments/#checking-the-status-of-a-refund) (`GET /v1/payments/{PAYMENT_ID}/refunds/{REFUND_ID}`) and looking at the `settlement_summary` object:

```json
"settlement_summary": {
  ...
  "settled_date": "2019-09-21",
}
```

`settled_date` will be either:

* the date Stripe took the refund from the payments that Stripe sent to your bank account
* missing if Stripe has not yet taken the refund

### Send email notifications about refunds

You can use the GOV.UK Pay admin tool to turn on sending refund email notifications to your users. To enable refund email notifications, select your service in [the GOV.UK admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services), select **Settings**, and set **Refund emails** to **On**.

## Get all refunds for a single payment

`GET /v1/payments/{PAYMENT_ID}/refunds`
