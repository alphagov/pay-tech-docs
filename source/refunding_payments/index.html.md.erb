# Refund a payment

You can refund all or part of a payment using the GOV.UK Pay API.

You can also refund a payment by signing into the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login).

Your user will receive the refund in the same account they originally paid from. You cannot refund a payment to another card or bank account.

## Check if you can refund a payment

Check if you can refund a payment by using the API to [get information about the payment](/reporting/#get-information-about-a-single-payment).

The API response includes a `refund_summary` object. For example, for a completed £50 payment with no previous refunds:

```javascript
"refund_summary": {
  "status": "available",
  "amount_available": 5000,
  "amount_submitted": 0
}
```

For a completed £90 payment where £30 has already been refunded:

```javascript
"refund_summary": {
  "status": "available",
  "amount_available": 6000,
  "amount_submitted": 3000
}
```

### status

|Status|Meaning|
|---|---|
|pending|You cannot refund the payment yet because your user has not completed the payment.|
|unavailable|You cannot refund the payment, usually because the payment failed.|
|available|You can refund the payment. Check how much you can refund in `amount_available`.|
|full|You cannot refund the payment because you've already refunded the full amount.|

### amount_available

`amount_available` is how much you can refund in pence. The amount includes any [transaction fees](/reporting/#psp-fees) and [corporate card fees](/corporate_card_surcharges/#add-corporate-card-fees).

### amount_submitted

`amount_submitted` is how much you've already refunded.

## Creating a refund

`POST /v1/payments/PAYMENT-ID/refunds`

If the `status` in the `refund_summary` object is `available`, you can create a refund with the GOV.UK Pay API.

Example refund request:

```javascript
{
  "amount": 2000,
  "refund_amount_available": 5000
}
```

### amount

`amount` is how much to refund your user in pence. You can refund all or part of the payment.

### refund_amount_available (optional)

`refund_amount_available` is the `amount_available` you received when you [checked if you can refund the payment](#check-if-you-can-refund-a-payment).

GOV.UK Pay will reject your refund request if `refund_amount_available` does not match the amount that's available to refund. This stops you accidentally refunding your user twice.

### Response

Example response:

```javascript
{
  "amount": 2000,
  "created_date": "2019-09-19T16:53:03.213Z",
  "refund_id": "j6se0f2o427g28g8yg3u3i",
  "status": "submitted",
  ...
}
```

If GOV.UK Pay could not successfully create the refund, the JSON response will contain an [API error code](/api_reference/#api-error-codes) and a description of the error.

## Checking the status of a refund

`GET /v1/payments/PAYMENT-ID/refunds/REFUND-ID`

The JSON response will include a `status` field.

It may take up to 30 minutes for the status to change. Do not check the status more than once every 5 minutes.

|status|Meaning|
|---|---|
|submitted|We've submitted your refund request to your PSP. Refunds do not have a `submitted` status if you're using your test account.|
|success|Your PSP has successfully processed the refund.|
|error|Your PSP could not process the refund, usually because your user's payment card is cancelled or expired, or you do not have enough money in your account to refund your user.|

## Where your PSP takes the refund amount from

If your user's payment did not reach your bank account yet, your PSP will:

- cancel the payment, if your PSP is Stripe, ePDQ or SmartPay
- take the refund amount after the payment has reached your bank account, if your PSP is Worldpay

If the payment has reached your bank account, your PSP will take the refund amount from:

- the next payment or payments you receive from any of your users, if your PSP is Stripe or ePDQ
- your bank account, if your PSP is SmartPay or Worldpay

If your PSP is Stripe, you can see when Stripe took the refund when you make an API call to [check the status of a refund](/refunding_payments/#checking-the-status-of-a-refund).

Example response:

```
"settlement_summary": {
  ...
  "settled_date": "2016-01-22",
}
```

settled_date will be either:

- the date Stripe took the refund from the payments that Stripe sent to your bank account
- missing if Stripe has not yet taken the refund

All dates are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

### Send email notifications about refunds

You can use the GOV.UK Pay admin tool to turn on [sending refund email notifications to your users](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/email-notifications).

## Getting a list of refunds

You can use the GOV.UK API to:

- get all refunds for a single payment
- search refunds

## Get all refunds for a single payment

`GET /v1/payments/PAYMENT-ID/refunds`

Example response:

```javascript
{
  "payment_id": "hu20sqlact5260q2nanm0q8u93",
  ...
  "_embedded": {
    "refunds": [
      {
        "refund_id": "act4c33g40j3edfmi8jknab84x",
        "created_date": "2019-09-19T16:52:07.855Z",
        "amount": 120,
        "status": "success"
      },
      {
        "refund_id": "9rwjbdcpjd54ol1btog2a8zowh",
        "created_date": "2019-09-20T20:46:01.121Z",
        "amount": 60,
        "status": "success"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Searching refunds

`GET /v1/refunds?<QUERYPARAMETERS>`

An example search request:

`GET
/v1/refunds?from_date=2019-09-20T13:30:00Z&to_date=2019-09-22T15:00:00Z`

### Filtering by date

You can use the following query parameters to filter refunds by date:

* `from_date`, which is the start date to search, inclusive
* `to_date`, which is the end date to search, exclusive

Dates must be in [ISO
8601 format](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/date-times-and-time-stamps-standard). For example `2019-09-20T13:30:00Z`.

### Filter refunds by when your PSP took refunds

If your payment service provider (PSP) is Stripe, you can use the following query parameters to filter by [when your PSP took refunds](/refunding_payments/#where-your-psp-takes-the-refund-amount-from):

- `from_settled_date` - the start date for payments to be searched, inclusive
- `to_settled_date` - the end date for payments to be searched, inclusive

All dates are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

For example, to list all the refunds your PSP took on 16 June 2020:

```
GET /v1/refunds?from_settled_date=2020-06-16&to_settled_date=2020-06-16
```

These query parameters take inputs based on a subset of the [ISO 8601 standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/date-times-and-time-stamps-standard). For example, a valid input would be `2015-08-13`.

### Splitting results into pages

You can use the following query parameters to split results into pages:

* `display_size`, which has a default of `500`, and must be between `1` and `500`
* `page`, which has a default of `1`

These must be positive integers.

For example, you run the following search and get 1500 refunds in the response:

`GET
/v1/refunds?from_date=2019-09-20T13:30:00Z&to_date=2019-09-22T15:00:00Z`

You could then get a single page of these refunds by running:

`GET
/v1/refunds?from_date=2019-09-20T13:30:00Z&to_date=2019-09-22T15:00:00Z&display_size=500&page=2`

This would return refunds 501 to 1000.
