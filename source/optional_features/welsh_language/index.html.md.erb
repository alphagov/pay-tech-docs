# Use Welsh on your payment pages

GOV.UK Pay supports Welsh-language payment pages.

You can also [create payment links in Welsh](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/).

To use Welsh, include `"language": "cy"` in the API request when you [create a new payment](/payment_flow/#making-a-payment). Your users will see Welsh text on the payment pages as they complete the [payment flow](/payment_flow).  If you do not specify a language,
GOV.UK Pay will default to using English-language payment pages.

Sign in to the [GOV.UK admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login) to add a Welsh service name to your service.

If you add a Welsh service name to your service, your users will see this on Welsh-language
payment pages instead of the English service name.

When your user makes a payment, they will also see a
[`description`](/payment_flow/#making-a-payment). If you use Welsh-language
payment pages, you may also want to use Welsh text in the
`description`.

GOV.UK Pay does not automatically translate emails into Welsh. If you want to send your own emails in Welsh, disable GOV.UK Pay sending emails by signing in to the [GOV.UK admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/settings/).

[Contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) if you'd like us to develop a feature to automatically translate emails into Welsh.
