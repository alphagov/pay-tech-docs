# Use Welsh on your payment pages

GOV.UK Pay supports Welsh language payment pages.

You can also [create payment links in Welsh](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/).

To use Welsh, include `"language": "cy"` in the API request when you [create a new payment](/making_payments/#creating-a-payment).

This example request creates a Â£50 fine that will use Welsh language payment pages:

`POST /v1/payments`

```json
{
  "amount": 5000,
  "reference" : "WA5678",
  "description": "Talu dirwy.",
  "return_url": "https://your.service.gov.uk/completed",
  "language": "cy"
}
```

If you do not include the `language` parameter in your request, GOV.UK Pay defaults to English language payment pages.

Your users see a [description of the payment](/payment_flow/#4-your-user-enters-their-payment-details) when they pay. If you use Welsh language payment pages, you may also want to use Welsh text in the `description`.

GOV.UK Pay does not automatically translate emails into Welsh. If you want to send your own emails in Welsh, stop GOV.UK Pay sending emails:

1. Sign in to [the GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services).
1. Select your service from the **Overview** page.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Change **Payment confirmation emails** to **Off**.

[Contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/) if you'd like us to develop a feature to automatically translate emails into Welsh.

## Add a Welsh service name

You can show a Welsh service name on payments that use Welsh language payment pages. 

Sign in to [the GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login) and select **Edit name** next to the service you want to add a Welsh name to.

Your users will see:

* the Welsh service name when making payments with Welsh language payment pages
* the English service name when making payments with English language payment pages
