# Welsh-language payment pages

GOV.UK Pay supports Welsh-language payment pages. 

To use Welsh, you can include `"language": "cy"` in the body of
a request to create a payment. Users will see Welsh text on the payment
pages as they complete the [payment flow](/payment_flow_overview).  

Sign in to your [GOV.UK Pay
account](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login) and use the admin
tool to add a Welsh service name to your service.  

If you add a Welsh service
name to your service, users will see this on Welsh-language payment pages instead of the
usual service name.  

When users make a payment, they will also [see a
`description`](/payment_flow_overview/#making-a-payment). If you use Welsh-language
payment pages, you may also want to use Welsh text in the
`description`.  

GOV.UK Pay does not automatically translate emails into Welsh. Please [contact
us](/support_contact_and_more_information) if you would like to send Welsh language emails to your users.
