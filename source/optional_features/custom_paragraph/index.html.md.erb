# Add content to your payment confirmation emails

You can add a custom paragraph to payment confirmation emails from GOV.UK Pay. A custom paragraph can give users extra information related to your service.

1. Sign in to [the GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services).
1. Select the service you want to change.
1. Select **About your service**, then select **Paying user email addresses**.
1. Select **Add a custom paragraph**.

If you [have added your organisation's branding to your payment confirmation emails](/optional_features/custom_branding/), you must use the custom paragraph to tell your users how to contact your service.
