# Take payments over the phone (‘MOTO’ payments)

We can set up your GOV.UK Pay account so you can fill in GOV.UK Pay payment pages with your users’ details.

This means you can take payments:

- over the phone
- by post

These payments are also known as Mail Order / Telephone Order (MOTO) payments.

You cannot take MOTO payments if your payment service provider (PSP) is SmartPay.

## Set up your account

Email [govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) and we’ll:

- review your [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) assessment](/security/#payment-card-industry-pci-compliance) to check you can take payments over the phone and by post
- enable MOTO payments in your account

## Create a MOTO payment

Make sure you've collected your user's:

- card number
- card expiry date
- card security code
- name from their card
- email address - if you’ve [enabled collecting your users’ email addresses](/integrate_with_govuk_pay/#collecting-your-users-39-billing-addresses)

Follow these steps to create and complete the MOTO payment.

1. If your PSP is Worldpay or ePDQ, make sure you're using an API key from your MOTO account in [your services](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services).

2. [Create a payment](/making_payments/#making-payments) with the GOV.UK Pay API, and include `moto: true` in the request body.

3. Go to the `next_url` included in the body of the response to your API call.

4. Fill in your user’s information on the **Enter card details** page.

    The **Enter Card Details** page will not have a billing address field, even if you've enabled collecting billing addresses.

5. Confirm the payment on the **Confirm your payment** page.

    You will not need to do a 3D Secure confirmation.

## Create an online payment

After we enable MOTO payments in your account, you can still create payments where your user fills in their details themselves.

[Create a payment](/making_payments/#making-payments) with the GOV.UK Pay API using:

- `moto: false` in the request body
- an API key from your normal account in [your services](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services), if your PSP is Worldpay or ePDQ
