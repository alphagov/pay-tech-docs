# Add custom branding

GOV.UK Pay supports custom branding on all pages in your payment journey.

You can use custom branding regardless of whether you [integrate your service](/integrate_with_govuk_pay/#how-to-integrate-with-the-gov-uk-pay-api) with GOV.UK Pay, or use [payment links](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/).

You can [contact the GOV.UK Pay
team](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) to request
customisation for the following features:

* the logo displayed in the left-hand or right-hand side of the top banner
* the background and border colour of the top banner
* the branding of your payment confirmation email

## Banner logo

You should [email us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) with an image of your desired custom banner logo. Your image should be:

* in PNG or SVG format
* at least 2x the size of the image that will be displayed on-screen
* cropped to leave minimal whitespace around the logo
* compressed (optimised for web)

## Banner background and border colour

You can make a request for custom colours [to GOV.UK Pay
directly](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us).

Colours are customised using hexadecimal representations.

## Reply-to email address

When you ask GOV.UK Pay to set up custom branding on your [payment confirmation emails](/payment_flow/#confirmation-email), you should specify a reply-to email address so your users can contact you.

This reply-to email address can be an email inbox for your service, or an automated response.

If you do not use custom branding on your payment confirmation emails, you cannot specify a reply-to email address.
