# Add your organisation's branding

GOV.UK Pay supports custom branding of your payment pages, payment confirmation emails, and refund confirmation emails. This lets you add your organisation's branding to your users' payment journeys. 

For payment pages and emails, you can customise:

* the logo displayed in the top banner
* the background colour of the top banner

On payment pages, you can also customise the border colour of the top banner.

Your branding applies to the test and live versions of a service.

To set up your branding:

1. Send us your banner logo, banner colours, and a reply-to email address (if you are customising your emails).
2. Add contact information to your payment confirmation emails.

## 1. Send us your logo, colours, and a reply-to email address

Send an [email to the GOV.UK Pay team](/support_contact_and_more_information/) with:

  * the services you want to apply your branding to
  * whether you want to apply your branding to your payment pages, your emails, or both
  * an image of your banner logo
  * your banner background and border colour as a [hexadecimal colour code](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp)
  * an email address that will receive replies from users (if you are using your branding on payment confirmation emails)

### Banner logo restrictions

To make your banner logo is clear on every device, your image must be:

* in PNG or SVG format
* at least 600 pixels in width
* at least 240 pixels in height
* cropped to leave minimal whitespace around the logo
* compressed (optimised for web)

## 2. Include contact information on your payment confirmation emails

If you add your branding to payment confirmation emails, you must [add a paragraph to those emails](/optional_features/custom_paragraph) that tells users how to contact you.

If you monitor the email address you gave us for replies from users, you can explain this in your custom paragraph. For example:

```
If you have any questions about this payment, reply to this email.
```

If you do not monitor the email address you gave us for replies from users, you must tell your users:

* that they should not reply to this email
* how they can contact your service

For example:

```
This email address is not monitored. Please do not reply to this email.
												
If you need to speak to us about this payment, please email example@example.com or call us on 0300 123 4567
```

You cannot add custom content to your refund email.
