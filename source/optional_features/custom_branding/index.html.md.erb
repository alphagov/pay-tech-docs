# Custom branding of payment pages

GOV.UK Pay supports custom branding on payment pages.

You can [contact the GOV.UK Pay](/support_contact_and_more_information) to
request customisation for the following features:

* the logo displayed in the left-hand side of the top banner
* the background and border colour of the top banner
* your payment confirmation email from GOV.UK Notify

### Banner logo

You should provide an image of your desired custom banner logo [to GOV.UK Pay
directly](/support_contact_and_more_information). Your image should be:

* in PNG or SVG format
* at least 2x the size of the image that will be displayed on-screen
* cropped to leave minimal whitespace around the logo
* compressed (optimised for web)

### Banner background and border colour

You can make a request for custom colours [to GOV.UK Pay
directly](/support_contact_and_more_information). 

Colours are customised using hexadecimal representations.
