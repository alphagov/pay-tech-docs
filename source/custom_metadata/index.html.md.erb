# Add custom metadata

You can add custom metadata to a new payment. For example, you can add a reference number from your finance or accounting system, so you can reconcile the payment later.

You add metadata when you make an API call to create a new payment.

If you're using [payment links](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/), you can add metadata by adding reporting columns in the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login).

Your users cannot see metadata while they're making a payment.

## Add metadata to a payment

Include a `metadata` object in the body of your request to [create a new payment](/making_payments/#take-a-payment), for example:

```javascript
"metadata": {
   "ledger_code": "AB100",
   "an_internal_reference_number": 200,
...
}
```

The `metadata` object must contain between 1 and 10 parameters.

Each parameter key must be a unique case-insensitive string between 1 and 30 characters long. If 2 or more keys are identical, the API will remove all but one of the identical keys from the `metadata` object.

The data type of each parameter value must be either a:

- string of no more than 100 characters
- number
- boolean

Parameter values can be empty.

The API response will include your metadata.

You cannot add or change metadata keys or values after you've created the payment request.

## Getting a payment's metadata

When you [get information about a single payment](/reporting/#get-information-about-a-single-payment) or [generate a list of payments](/reporting/#generate-a-list-of-payments-matching-search-criteria), the API response will include the `metadata` object.

The order of the parameters in the `metadata` object may be different to your original object.

You can sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login) to see or download a payment's metadata. You can also use a payment's metadata to locate that payment in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool.
