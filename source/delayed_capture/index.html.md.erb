# Delay taking a payment

You can control how long it takes GOV.UK Pay to take ('capture') a payment from your user's bank account after your payment service provider (PSP) has authorised that payment.

You may want to use delayed capture if you need time to do your own anti-fraud checks on payments, or check that users are eligible for your service.

During the delay, your user's available bank balance is reduced by the payment amount.

You cannot use delayed capture for:

* payments made with [payment links](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/)
* [recurring payments](/recurring_payments)

To use this feature, include `"delayed_capture": true` in the body of your [request to create a new payment](/making_payments/#creating-a-payment) request:

`POST /v1/payments`

```json
{
  "amount": 5000,
  "reference" : "LE2504",
  "description": "Pay a penalty charge notice (PCN)",
  "return_url": "https://your.service.gov.uk/completed",
  "delayed_capture": true
}
```

Your user will follow the standard payment flow. After your user selects
__Confirm__ on the __Confirm your details__ page:

- the [payment's status](/api_reference/#payment-status-lifecycle) will change to `capturable`
- your service can make a request to the
`POST /v1/payments/{PAYMENT_ID}/capture` endpoint to send a delayed capture
request

Your service must send the delayed capture request within 120 hours (5 days) of creating the payment, regardless of when your user completes the payment flow. If you do not, [the payment will expire](/payment_flow/#6-your-user-confirms-payment).

If you've turned on payment confirmation emails, GOV.UK Pay will send a
payment confirmation email to your user once we've received and processed your serviceâ€™s capture request.

You can see definitions and possible values of every parameter and attribute for this endpoint in our [API reference](/api_reference/capture_payment_reference). You can also view [possible responses to your capture request](/api_reference/#responses).

## See the capture URL for a payment

If a payment is available for capture, you can see its capture URL in
responses to API requests. For example:

* `GET /v1/payments`
* `GET /v1/payments/{PAYMENT_ID}`

Replace ``{PAYMENT_ID}`` with the ID of the payment you want to see the capture URL for.

The `_links` object will contain:

```
"capture": {
"href": "https://publicapi.payments.service.gov.uk/v1/payments/{PAYMENT_ID}/capture",
    "method": "POST"
    }
```

If the payment is not available for capture, the `_links` object will not contain a `capture` object.
