# Quick start guide

GOV.UK Pay is based on REST principles with endpoints returning data in JSON
format, and standard HTTP error response codes. The platform API allows you
to:

- begin and complete payments
- issue refunds
- view the event history for individual payments
- view transactions within a specified time period

Once you [have a sandbox account](/before_you_start/#before-you-start), follow
these instructions to get started with our API Explorer and make a test API
call. 

## Generate API Key for API Explorer

1. Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin
   site](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/) with the sandbox
   account login details you received.

2. From the landing page, select __API key__, then __Generate a new key__.

<br /><br />Your API key will be shown for you to copy:<br /><br /> ![](images/NewKeygenerate+image+3.png)


<blockquote>You must store your API keys securely. You must not share 
this key in publicly accessible documents or repositories. You must not share
it with anyone who should not be using the GOV.UK Pay API directly.</blockquote>
 
[Read the "Security" section](/security/#security) for more information on how
to keep your API key safe.

## API Explorer setup

The quickest way to get started with the API is to use the <a
href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/" target="blank">API
Explorer</a> (link opens in new window) with your API key. 

1. Sign in to the API Explorer and select __Add API Key__.<br/><br/>
   ![](images/pay-add-api-key.png) <br/><br/>
2.  In the pop-up, enter the following values:

  * For __API Key__, enter your sandbox API key. You do not need to add the
  "Bearer: " prefix, because the API Explorer adds that automatically.  
  * For __Label__, enter `Authorization`. 

> Do not use an API key from a live account on the GOV.UK Pay admin site. Only
> use a sandbox API key 

## Make a test API call

This section describes how to make a test API call to GOV.UK Pay, by creating
a new payment.  This is the same call your service will make when beginning a
payment using GOV.UK Pay.

1. Sign in to <a href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/"
   target="blank">the API Explorer</a> (link opens in new window).  
2. Under __Resource__, select __General__. Under __Action__, select <a
   href="https://gds-payments.gelato.io/api-explorer/gov-uk-pay-api/versions/1.0.2/general/create-new-payment"
   target="blank">__Create new payment__</a> (link opens in new window) Select
   the __Body__ tab down to see an example JSON body that you would send when
   creating a payment.

```javascript
{
"amount": 12000,
"reference": "12345",
"description": "New passport application",
"return_url": "https://service-name.gov.uk/transactions/12345"
}
```

You also need to send a ``return_url`` when you create a payment. This is
because users go to pages hosted by GOV.UK Pay to actually
make payments.  The ``return_url`` is the URL of a page on your service
that the user will be redirected to after they have completed their payment
(or payment has failed).  <br/><br/>

Services that use sandbox accounts can optionally use HTTP, rather than HTTPS,
for return URLs. You can read more about this in [the "Security"
section](/security/#https). 

1. Select the green __Send Request__ button.

2. If the API Explorer is set up correctly, you will receive a `201 Created`
   response with a JSON body, confirming that the payment was created:

   ![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pay-govuk-documentation/pay-api-explorer-response.png)
   
   The JSON includes a ``next_url`` link. This URL is where your service
   should redirect the user for them to make their payment.  <br/><br/>

## Simulate an end-user payment journey 

Go to the ``next_url`` with a browser, and you'll see the payment screen.
Choose a mock card number from the ["Testing GOV.UK
Pay"](/testing_govuk_pay/#mock-card-numbers-for-testing-purposes) section and
enter it to simulate a payment in the sandbox environment. For the other
required details, enter some test information which should have:

  * an expiry date that is in the future and in the format MM/YYYY 
  * a valid postcode 

Submit the payment.

## View transactions at GOV.UK Pay admin site

Go to the [GOV.UK Pay admin
site](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/). From the landing page,
select __Transactions__:  

![](images/transaction+list+image+4.png)

Enter search criteria to find transactions using the available filters.
