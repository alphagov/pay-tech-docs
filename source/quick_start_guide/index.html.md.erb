# Quick start

<%= warning_text('You must store your API keys securely. You must not share this key in publicly accessible documents or repositories. You must not share it with anyone who should not be using the GOV.UK Pay API directly.') %>

Read this section to learn about what to do to get started with GOV.UK Pay.

## Before you start

Before you start using GOV.UK Pay, you should:

* read how to [get started](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/getstarted/) and decide if GOV.UK
Pay is right for your service
* sign up to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/create-service/register)
* read the GOV.UK Service Manual guidance on [deploying new
software](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/deployment.html)
* visit our <a href="https://govukpay-api-browser.cloudapps.digital/" target="blank">API browser</a> or look at our <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/pay-publicapi/blob/master/swagger/swagger.json" target="blank">Swagger file</a>

If you want to build a technical integration between your service and the
GOV.UK Pay API, your service team should have the necessary skills. You can
refer to the [GOV.UK Service
Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/what-each-role-does-in-service-team#roles-your-team-must-have)
for more information. This does not apply if you only use [payment
links](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/govuk-payment-pages/).

## The GOV.UK Pay API

The GOV.UK Pay API is based on REST principles with endpoints returning data
in JSON format, and standard HTTP error response codes. The platform API
allows you to:

* begin and complete payments
* view the event history for individual payments
* view transactions and refunds within a specified time period
* issue full or partial refunds

You'll be able to generate API keys for 2 different accounts. These are your:

- test account, for [testing the GOV.UK Pay API and your service](/testing_govuk_pay)
- live account, for taking payments from your users after you [switch to live](/switching_to_live)

When you've signed up for a test account, follow these instructions to get started
with our API and make a test API call.

## Test the API

### Generate a test API key

1. Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin
   tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/) with the test
   account login details you received.

2. Select __API keys__, then generate a new key.

Make sure you [keep your API keys safe](/security/#securing-your-developer-keys).

<%= warning_text('Only use a test API key on your test account. Do not use a live API key on your test account.') %>

### Make a test API call

You can make test API calls to GOV.UK Pay with your test API key.

You can use API testing tools such as <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a> or <a href="https://insomnia.rest/" target="_blank">Insomnia REST</a> to make test API calls.

This section shows an example API call and request body, to make a new payment
for a passport application:

```POST /v1/payments```

```javascript
{
"amount": 12000,
"reference": "12345",
"description": "New passport application",
"return_url": "https://service-name.gov.uk/transactions/12345"
}
```

Services that use test accounts can optionally use HTTP, rather than HTTPS,
for return URLs.

If the test call is successful, you will receive a `201 Created` response with
a JSON body.

The JSON includes a ``next_url`` link. This URL is where your service should
redirect your user for them to make their payment.

Read more about [taking payments](/making_payments/#take-a-payment).

### Simulate your users' payment journey

Go to the ``next_url`` with a browser, and youâ€™ll see the payment screen.
Choose a [mock card number](/testing_govuk_pay/#mock-card-numbers) and
enter it to simulate a payment in the test environment. For the other required
details, enter some test information which should have:

  * an expiry date that is in the future and in the format MM/YYYY

  * a valid postcode

Submit the payment.

### View transactions at GOV.UK Pay admin tool

Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin
tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/) and select __Transactions__.

You can also view test transactions using the API.
